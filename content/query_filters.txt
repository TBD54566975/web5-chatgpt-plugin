| **`recordId`**      | Property contains the message recordId               | "aa36ec55-c59b-4f20-8143-10f74aac696d" |
| **`parentId`**      | `recordId` of the parent record in a protocol        | "iadsfdreianzpmasdffcgam5mys722vnd..." |

Examples:

Filter by parentId
This snippet queries the DWN for records that have a parent record with a specific record ID:

const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        parentId: 'bafyreianzpmhbgcgam5mys722vnsiuwn7y4ek6kjeyjptttquasw4hge2m',
      },
    },
});


Filter by protocol and protocolPath
assuming playlist and video records have been created using this protocol, the following snippet demonstrates how to query for video records that match the protocol:

const { records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        protocol: 'https://playlist.org/protocol',
        protocolPath: 'playlist/video'
      },
    },
});
