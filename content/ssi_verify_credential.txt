How to verify a credential from an issuer with SSI Service

-----

As a part of SSI Service, `/v1/credentials/verification` is used as a stateless utility to verify any credential.

To verify the VC, run the follow command after replacing the credentialJWT value with the one from your credential:

```bash
curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/credentials/verification -d '{
    "credentialJwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6..."
}'
```

This performs the following verification process:

✅ Make sure the credential is complaint with the VC Data Model

✅ Make sure the credential is not expired

✅ Make sure the signature of the credential is valid (currently supports both JWT and some Linked Data credentials)

✅ Make sure its data complies with the credential schema if one exists (note: the schema must be hosted within the service)

Upon success the following response should be returned:

```json
{ 
  "verified": true
}
```
