Shows how to sort query results of DWN records and protocols
-----

Query results can be sorted via the dateSort field. Valid values for dateSort are:

* createdAscending - sorts by dateCreated in ascending order
* createdDescending - sorts by dateCreated in descending order
* publshedAscending	- sorts by datePublished in ascending order
* publishedDescending- sorts by datePublished in descending order


//Ascending Order - queries for records with a plain text data format, and returns them in ascending order by the date they were published:
const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        dataFormat: 'text/plain',
      },
      dateSort: 'publishedAscending',
    },
  });


//Descending Order - queries for protocols with a certain URL, and returns them in descending order by the date they were created.
const { protocols } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({
    message: {
      filter: {
        protocol: 'http://social-media.xyz',
      },
      dateSort: 'createdDescending'
    },
  });
