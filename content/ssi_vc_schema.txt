How to create a credential schema with SSI Service

-----

A Credential Schema is a document that defines the structure of a Verifiable Credential (VC). It's based on JSON Schema and specifies which properties the issuer will use to create the VC.

1. Construct the JSON Schema and specify if any of the properties are required. Here's an example of a VC Schema for an email address

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/email.json",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "name": "Email Address",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "emailAddress": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email"
    }
  },
  "required": ["emailAddress"]
}
```

The $id keyword identifies a schema resource with its canonical URI. Note that this URI is an identifier and not necessarily a network locator. In the case of a network-addressable URL, a schema does not need to be downloadable from its canonical URI.

2. Create Credential Schema

To apply a JSON Schema to a Verifiable Credential, add your data properties in the `credentialSubject` section of the JSON:

```json
curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/schemas -d '{
  "name": "Email Credential",
  "schema": {
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "credentialSubject": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "emailAddress": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "email"
          }
        },
        "required": ["emailAddress"]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```
