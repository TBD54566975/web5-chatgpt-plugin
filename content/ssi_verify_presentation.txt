How to verify a presentation with SSI Service

-----

A VC holder may provide a Verifiable Presentation for verification, which is an object that serves as an authenticated wrapper around a set of credentials they wish to have verified.

You can use the SSI Service to verify a VC Presentation by making a `PUT` request to `/v1/presentations/verification`. A sample request is as follows:

```bash
curl -X PUT localhost:3000/v1/presentations/verification -d '{
    "presentationJwt": "eyJhbGciOixlQ3JlZGVudGlhbCI6WyJ..."
}'
```

Upon success we see a response such as:

```json
{ 
  "verified": true
}
```
