Shows how to publish a record.

-----

When records are created, they are private by default. Private records are not accessible without the use of protocols or permissions. To make a record publicly available, the record must be published. 

To publish a record, you must specify the `published` attribute as `true` in the message object on creation of the record. 

To publish a record immediately:

```js
const {record} = await web5.dwn.records.create({
    data: "a record that will be created and published now",
    message: {
        dataFormat: "text/plain",
        published: true,
    }
});
```


To publish a record at a specific future or past date, you must include the `datePublished` attribute when creating the record. 
If `datePublished` is not specified, it will publish the record immediately. If `datePublished` is specified, it will publish the record at the specified date.

To publish a record at a future date (e.g., tomorrow):

```js
import { Temporal } from '@js-temporal/polyfill';

let today = Temporal.Now.instant();
let tomorrow = today.add({seconds: 86400});

//Create a record
const {record} = await web5.dwn.records.create({
    data: "a record that will be created now and published tomorrow",
    message: {
        dataFormat: "text/plain",
        published: true,
        datePublished: tomorrow.toString({smallestUnit: 'microseconds' }),,
    }
});
```
