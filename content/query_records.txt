// from - string: The DID of the DWN the query will fetch results from.
// message - object: The properties of the DWN Message Descriptor that will be used to construct a valid DWeb Node message.


const response = await web5.dwn.records.query({
  from: 'did:example:alice',
  message: {
    filter: {
      schema: 'https://schema.org/Playlist',
      dataFormat: 'application/json'
    }
