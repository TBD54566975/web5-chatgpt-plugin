Right now your bank balance, credit card transaction history and the identity information on your utility bills are in dozens of databases owned by dozens of companies with dozens of terms of service you probably haven‚Äôt read. The Verifiable Credential Selector (VCS) is an open source widget that makes it easy for you to gain possession of your data from Financial Technology (FinTech) apps. VCS uses Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials so once you have control of your data, you can selectively share only what‚Äôs required - instantly rather than waiting minutes.Today, we are announcing the 0.1 release of the VCS that allows retrieving data from MX.com and Sophtron.com and providing it to the FinTech app that embeds the VCS.In the next few months, tbDEX will release the infrastructure for users to take possession and the VCS will make this upgrade easy for FinTech companies because today‚Äôs version uses the same standardized data format.With the two providers, MX and Sophtron, already integrated, users can retrieve data from over 40,000 banks, brokerages, apps, utility companies, credit card companies and other financial institutions.If you are building a FinTech app, are a data provider, or just want to help make Self-Sovereign Identity and Web 5 a reality, please reach out on our Forum or Discord, or open an issue on GitHub.Tags:Verifiable CredentialsIncubationNewer PostCurrency of FreedomOlder PostAnnouncing the Incubation Program2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

that gives individuals control over their personal data. With SSI, people can
manage their personal information, credentials, and other digital assets,
without relying on centralized authorities. At benri, we are proud to provide a
playground for TBD's SSI Service
at our subdomain ssi.benri, where users can explore the
power of SSI in a secure and easy-to-use environment. This is not meant to be
used for production, but can be a hands-on learning experience for those
interested in building decentralized apps and learning more about SSI.At Benri, users can access TBD's SSI-Service, which supports a wide range of SSI functionality. Users cancreate and manage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), which provide a unique identifier for each user in a
decentralized system. create and manage Verifiable Credentials (VCs), which allow users to share their identity information and credentials with others in a secure and privacy-preserving way. facilitate credential suspension, credential revocations, applying for credentials, exchanging credentials, and data schemas for credentials and other verifiable data. It is not meant for production use, but is a learning tool to learn more about SSI technology.To make it easy for users to access the SSI-Service, benri is providing 3 main endpoints:ssi.benri: which hosts a streamlit application.docs: which hosts the swagger docsssi.benri.io/api: which hosts the API
endpoints corresponding to the docs. It hosts the RESTful API's which can be
used to manage your services.See below for an example of a DID resolution using the SSI Service API's:# resolve a didcurl -X GET  https://ssi.benri.io/api/v1/dids/resolver/did:key:z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2{"didResolutionMetadata":{"ContentType":"","Error":null},"didDocument":{"@context":"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1","id":"did:key:z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2","verificationMethod":[{"id":"#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2","type":"Ed25519VerificationKey2018","controller":"did:key:z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2","publicKeyBase58":"HRQkCkE6CXcxhJmeK1cZCPzDLdqyDHpPv4pK2LQALo9e"}],"authentication":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]],"assertionMethod":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]],"keyAgreement":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]],"capabilityDelegation":[["#z6MkvsfnnzUXY57RoocLzaaQ3VYDAD7pdB4kc5jErcNBG1w2"]]},"didDocumentMetadata":{}}%The docs have additional API's listed.The SSI service is a bridge to learning more about the decentralized web and

Now there is a whole lot of (let's face it: tedious) machinery to get WASM to be compiled from Go (ok if you are really curious you can read the code), but the upshot of it is that there is a .wasm file produced which when consumed in just the right way in a web page, allows you to call functions from JavaScript, that look and feel like JavaScript, but are actually running in the web-assembly machiner (and compiled down from Golang).Say you had a function in Golang land which looked like this: // Resolve attempts to resolve a DID for a given methodfunc (dr Resolver) Resolve(did string, opts ...ResolutionOptions) (*DIDResolutionResult, error) {  ...You could call it from the web via:console.log(resolveDid("did:peer:0z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH"));and it would Just Work thanks to WASM!
Well, thanks to WASM and a lot of boring glue. ChatGPT‚ÄãBut the boring glue is what I am here to talk about it, as it turns out ChatGPT can be quite helpful for the boring (but important) glue. So firstly, there is some work to be done to build a shim between the JavaScript type world and the Golang type world: // 1. Simplest function - note we wrap things with js.ValueOf (if a primitive you don't technically need to)func sayHello(_ js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {    return js.ValueOf("Hello from golang via wasm!")}This gets more complicated when you have more complicated types, but essentially this is the pattern you follow to expose functionality. Now I am a pretty ordinary Golang developer, so being lazy I thought I would see if I could teach ChatGPT about WASM and if it could write this glue code for me. Helpfully the SSI-SDK has a good amount of test coverage, so to teach ChatCPT about the API I was trying to expose, I pasted in a test case which exercised the API. The functionality was the "Resolve" function above, and the test code showed how to use it. I then asked ChatGPT to provide a WASM friendly wrapper for that functionality:To do this, I gave it an example of some previously written code that uses some (unrelated) functionality and also exposes it to WASM. As you can see it was happy to provide an implementation which whilst close, with some minor tweaking. I was able to tidy it up and include it in the pull request. Handy - thanks ChatGPT!
Moreover, as I am an ordinary Golang developer I was able to ask it to put in a retry on error (also some important glue) when using WASM from a web app (this staved a minor amount of googling): Parting thoughts‚ÄãWASM seems surpremely useful, and ChatGPT, while terrifying on one level, looks like it can really take away some of the grind work from developers, allowing us to move much faster into more platforms. And no, this post was NOT written by ChatGPT, but by a human.Tags:Self Sovereign IdentitySSIAIChatGPTNewer PostWhat Happens To My Content If TikTok Gets Banned?Older PostCurrency of FreedomWeb AssemblyChatGPTParting thoughts2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

With Web5, traditional authentication methods are no longer the sole means of verifying identity and ownership. Instead, users can leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to establish their digital presence while retaining full control over their data. Let's explore how this revolutionizes authentication and content ownership as we know it. Decentralized Identifiers, or DIDs, lie at the heart of Web5's identity management. DIDs provide individuals with unique and globally resolvable identifiers that are persistent and always under their control. By using a DID, users establish their online presence, similar to a username. This paradigm shift empowers individuals to manage and control their personal information, granting them the freedom to partake in various online platforms all while owning the content and data they share.Web5 applications eliminate the need for centralized authorities to authenticate us through methods such as two-factor authentication or username/password combinations. Instead, DIDs, alongside data associated with DIDs like Verifiable Credentials, become the foundation of trust. When users interact with Web5 applications, they present claims associated with their DIDs as proof of identity. These applications can verify the authenticity of the user's attestations without the need for traditional username/password authentication.How It Works‚ÄãLet's delve into the technical aspects of this. When you acquire a DID, it comes with a public-private key pair. Your DID can be resolved by anyone into a DID document, containing your public key, similar to a username that can be copied and pasted into a login screen. However, to prove that you are the rightful owner of the DID and it is indeed you logging in, your private key becomes crucial. Your private key should never be shared, and it allows you to generate a digital signature. Whenever you author a message, it automatically carries a digital signature. To verify the same message, it requires the public key. For example, when logging into example.com, sending a message and successfully authenticating it, the online platform will utilize your public key for verification. If the verification process is successful, they can confirm that you are the rightful owner of the given DID, without ever needing your private key.With Web5 authentication, you can effortlessly create an account, free from the hassle of coming up with a new handle or hoping your existing usernames are available. Instead, you can embrace the simplicity of using your DID. Your DID becomes a personalized "username" that you can use to log into any supporting app's login screen.Your DID serves as a URI (Unique Resource Identifier) that leads to your DID document, acting as a special hub providing a glimpse into your digital identity. Within your DID document, the application utilizes the URIs as guideposts, leading them to your DWNs (Decentralized Web Nodes) which store your content and data.This user-friendly approach relieves you from the burdens of creating new content or manually downloading from one platform to upload on another. All the content to which you have granted the application access to will be readily available for the application to read/write to, simply by logging in with your DID.Benefits of Authentication with Web5‚ÄãOne of the biggest benefits of this is the shift in content ownership. In traditional web applications, content is often stored on centralized servers, placing it under the control of the service provider you've created an account with or you're logged into. However, in Web5, individuals maintain ownership and control over their content. When users create and publish content within a Web5 application, their DIDs are linked to that content, establishing a clear link between the creator and their work. The user's content is stored in their own datastore, a DWN, as opposed to stored on the platform they‚Äôve logged into. This ownership grants users greater autonomy and enables them to decide how their content is shared, used, and monetized.Another benefit is the enhanced security this type of content ownership and authentication provides. With traditional web applications, data breaches and unauthorized access are a common problem that pose a significant risk to the user and the company that holds this data. In Web5, the distributed nature of the infrastructure gives the users full ownership over their data/content that is stored and protected in their DWN. By reducing the reliance on centralized servers, where multiple people have access to a user‚Äôs data the impact of potential security breaches is lower. Empowering users to have more confidence in their online interactions.Web5 represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of the web, redefining its landscape as we know it.

In that post we discussed some high-level concepts behind how and why DIDs could solve many of the identity and data problems we face today, but today let‚Äôs dive deep on a specific problem set DIDs could solve: parental controls and minors‚Äô digital security.It‚Äôs an inescapable reality for parents today that their kids will be online. There‚Äôs no avoiding the reality that minors are going to consume a diverse array of content and interact with others on the internet, but parents do want to have a say in what‚Äôs put in front of their children. Digital safety is already incorporated by some services - such as Netflix - and platforms - like iOS - but universal parental controls and safety monitoring don‚Äôt presently exist. That could change, however, via DIDs and a concept known as DID controllers.Before we dive into how DIDs can facilitate universal parental controls, it‚Äôs fair to acknowledge that giving adults the ability to have such control over minors may represent a potential risk to those minors‚Äô freedoms. While that is absolutely a valid concern, it‚Äôs also true that regardless of DIDs or Web5, as a society we are pushing forward towards a future with more sophisticated parental controls. Federal lawmakers recently introduced a bipartisan bill that seeks to establish a national minimum age for posting on social media, signaling this direction in public policy. The ‚ÄúProtecting Kids on Social Media Act'' would ban platforms like TikTok, Snap, and Instagram from letting kids younger than 13 create accounts ‚Äî and require platforms to get parental consent to open accounts for users under 18. With things like government-run age verification and limitations on tracking minors, it‚Äôs very clear that minors will experience restrictions and the infrastructure to enforce those restrictions is coming. In this post, we‚Äôll cover how Web5 could provide the implementation of that system.DID Controllers and the Controller Paradigm‚ÄãEvery DID is a string representation of an entity - the subject - that is described by a DID document enumerating things like cryptographic public keys and delegate/controller patterns. Those patterns allow for another DID, the controller, to make changes to the DID document. So what does this all mean for parents?Minors are constantly interacting with new digital and physical services that carry age restrictions or limitations. For example, it‚Äôs generally viewed as a good thing when platforms censor certain content from being viewable to those under 18. While these types of constraints are generally tied to age and state-issued licenses, those forms of identification can be forged and circumvented and offer no entry point for parents to intervene. A DID controller model, however, allows for parents to intervene at an identity level to place appropriate restrictions on their children.Parents of a DID Child: A Case Study‚ÄãImagine Alice and Bob welcome their new daughter Carol into the world, and at birth she‚Äôs assigned a DID over which Alice and Bob are made controllers. Immediately, whenever anyone tries to resolve Carol‚Äôs DID and obtain her DID document, they‚Äôll see that Alice and Bob‚Äôs DIDs are controllers over her DID. As Alice and Bob check their daughter out of the hospital, there‚Äôll be a million pieces of paperwork to fill, but proving their identity will be easy so long as they provide proof that they own the DIDs that are controllers over Carol‚Äôs DID.As Carol starts to take her first steps, Alice and Bob enroll her in daycare. Wanting to be certain only Alice, Bob, and their parents can pick up Carol from daycare, Alice and Bob edit Carol‚Äôs DID document to ensure that the ‚Äúdaycare‚Äù or ‚Äúsupervision‚Äù protocol only allows for Carol to be picked up by the specified DID-holders.With Carol growing older, she may begin to want to explore more shows and media than the educational programs her parents put on for her. Alice and Bob may want to allow Carol to explore the internet on her own a bit, so they give her access while restricting her usage. For now, she‚Äôs only allowed to visit YouTube with some strict parental filters they‚Äôve set at her DID-level, so that even when they graduate her to more websites she does not accidentally stumble onto content they don‚Äôt want her seeing. Additionally, because they‚Äôre controlling her DID and not just her account on a single service, any service that accepts that DID and communicates over the protocols that they‚Äôve specified will honor the restrictions they‚Äôve placed on their daughter. For example, let‚Äôs say Alice and Bob want to always restrict videos that contain violence from being viewable by Carol, and do so by specifying that videos with violence should be blocked according to a universal video content moderation protocol. Then, all content platforms that respect the universal video content moderation protocol should automatically block that content!With her teenage years coming on, Carol may be tempted to stay up late and message her friends, but mom and dad know that Carol needs her sleep. Bob and Alice could, as controllers, restrict her access to her texts after 10pm with the exception of a few critical family members.Finally, when Carol does age out of her parents‚Äô home, they can relinquish their controllership or even set it to expire at a given date. This parental use case is perfect for Web5 as it showcases how open, universal protocols, a decentralized web, and DID controllership enable improved and seamless experiences over our currently fractured, standardless web.If all of this sounds interesting to you, join us in building Web5 by checking out our GitHub, including our growing web5.js SDK, where you can find and collaborate on the tools we‚Äôre creating to build the next web.Tags:Decentralized IdentityDID ControllerNewer PostWeb5 App Wins did:hack HackathonOlder PostTBD partners with Benri to host the SSI ConsoleDID Controllers and the Controller ParadigmParents of a DID Child: A Case Study2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

From connecting with friends and family to building brands and businesses, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given us the power to create digital personas that resonate with others where your user handle serves as a unique identifier in the digital world. However, recent incidents have shed light on a fundamental question: Do we truly own our user handles on these platforms? Events, such as Twitter's rebranding and the subsequent takeover of the @X handle from a longtime user, shed light on the intricate web of ownership, accountability that revolves around these usernames, and how account models across the web work today.Borrowing vs. Owning‚ÄãUser handles, also known as usernames, are a string of characters that represent your digital presence on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. While users assume that the handles they create are tied to their accounts, the reality is more complex, often dictated by the terms of service set by the platform. These terms outline the rights and limitations users have over their usernames/accounts, establishing a virtual "landlord and tenant" relationship between you and the platform provider. This relationship was exemplified when Twitter rebranded as "X," causing collateral damage as the company took repossession of user handles like @X, without notice or monetary compensation. This was echoed in cases like @Music, which was created by a user who curated their digital presence with this handle for more than 16 years. The notice from Twitter to this account holder reads:The user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp. Accordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle. While this is certainly alarming, it‚Äôs not illegal. Most people don‚Äôt read the fine print of the Terms of Service agreements when joining these applications, and therefore don‚Äôt realize how much control these centralized organizations have over our data and digital identity.  The Problem & The Solution‚ÄãThe way the web stands today, each time we engage with online platforms that require accounts, we borrow an identity from them and then proceed to build a reputation and possibly a brand associated with this borrowed identity. The recent turmoil experienced by Twitter has thrust the very nature of the web into the spotlight for those who previously might not have contemplated its issues. This is precisely why Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) bear immense significance.At the core of Web5's paradigm lie DIDs, which serve as identities that users own and control. DIDs provide individuals with distinctive, universally resolvable identifiers that persist through time and consistently remain under their control. Unlike conventional usernames, DIDs can't be confiscated by platforms, thus empowering users to truly possess their digital identities. This transformative shift adds an identity layer to the web eradicating platform-mediated handles.Fortunately, Twitter automatically gave the user who created @X a new (albeit way less cool) handle. However, what if the company simply closed that account instead? The user would have  lost not just their username, but potentially their entire digital existence on that platform if their profile had been wiped out.  While Twitter's actions towards these users might not have violated any legal boundaries, is this the way we truly want the web to be? Social media has transcended its original purpose of mere social interaction; it now intertwines with our livelihoods. When signing up for a new platform many of us adopt the same usernames. These usernames serve as both personal and professional branding tools, encapsulating not just our individual identities but also the essence of our businesses.Web5 will revolutionize identity management by restoring it to us, the users, while allowing applications to focus solely on enhancing our user experience. Twitter Space with Industry Leaders‚ÄãIndustry leaders Angie Jones, Kelsey Hightower, and Daniel Buchner discussed this very topic on a recent Twitter Space. Tune in to hear their thoughts on how Decentralized Identity solves this problem.Tags:Decentralized IdentitySocial MediaNewer PostPreptember Diaries- Gearing Up for Hacktoberfest 2023!Older PostProtocol-Based Messaging with HomeNode ManagerBorrowing vs. OwningThe Problem & The SolutionTwitter Space with Industry Leaders2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Here are a few ways they are being used today.Employment Verification‚ÄãLinkedIn recently announced a new free verified badge feature that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. ‚ÄúThe system is backed by decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company‚Ä¶‚Äù LinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee's DID (subject) with their employer's DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.As for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a Verifiable Credential (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.infoDIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.Digital Driver's Licenses‚ÄãThe DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing digital driver's licenses and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver's license apps are cryptographically secure and can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents. These apps are backed with the use of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and DIDs. This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.COVID Digital Health Apps‚ÄãIBM used VCs as a key component in its Digital Health Pass solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.When an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. There are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. Overall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.Social Media‚ÄãEven social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the AT Protocol, a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social). Unbeknownst to most users, these domain names are associated with a DID for the user.These persistent DIDs enable users to migrate their account data to any other applications that utilize the AT Protocol - therefore giving users more control and ownership over their content.Future of Decentralized Identity‚ÄãThese companies are embracing the use of decentralized technology for identity management and verification at a massive scale. As this technology continues to mature, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of DIDs in various industries.Want to learn more about DIDs and VCs?

PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.What changes in a DWA?The basic client-server model that PWAs use is and has been the presumed standard for decades now. Users expect to open up their PWA, a client, that routinely makes API calls to a 3rd party service, the server, where all their data is stored and the business logic of the app lives. For example, a basic ToDo app PDA would provide you a UI to interface with all your action items by calling the API service that accesses those items; fundamentally the data and API layers live outside of the user‚Äôs control and ownership.In DWAs, users own their own data and, as a result, their apps no longer need an API service because apps connect directly to the data source. This shift leads to virtually no UI/UX change, but triggers a radical change in app architecture because developers are now directly interfacing with a user‚Äôs data store instead of with app-owned server storage via API. In DWAs, app data is stored in Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), which are user-owned and redundant data stores capable of transmitting data that provide strong promises of privacy and guaranteed ownership. DWNs can be permissioned publicly or privately related to the querying decentralized identifier (DID) using permissions and protocols to allow select access to all the data stored in them. Going back to our ToDo app example, a user would be able to store all of their todo items and app data on their own DWN rather than on a specific 3rd party‚Äôs servers, and all the app would do is focus on creating a presentation layer and additional features around the app‚Äôs concept. Upgrading to DWAsIf you want to migrate a PWA to a DWA, the only thing you‚Äôll need to do is make sure that whatever data you were originally storing remotely and transmitting via API calls is now stored on the user‚Äôs DWN and is accessed using CRUD operations on the user‚Äôs DWN. For example, your ToDo app may have previously made an API call to write a new item to your list, but now you‚Äôd replace that API call with:// Write a plain text record to the in-memory DWNconst myRecord = await web5.dwn.records.create(myDid.id, { data: todoItem, message: {     dataFormat: 'text/plain', },});You might expect this section on how to migrate your PWA to a DWA to drag on, but that‚Äôs really it! Regardless of your front-end frameworks, you can easily turn your app into a DWA using our web5.js library with minimal code changes. So long as your application treats the user‚Äôs DWN as its data storage and allows the user to own their own data, your PWA is now a DWA.Benefits of a DWAEven though replacing all your API calls with DWA calls may be relatively easy work, convincing your users to get on board with Web5 and DWNs may be a challenge. So what‚Äôs in it for you and them when you build a DWA?User ownership of data - users don‚Äôt have to worry about a server outage or be fearful of a company shutting down and losing all their data.Data portability - because users are storing their own data in PWAs, they no longer need to be tied to a single service. Imagine, for example, a world with a decentralized Spotify and Tidal. If a Spotify user were to decide to leave the platform and migrate to Tidal, they‚Äôd own all their own playlist data and could therefore then give playlist access to Tidal so that all their data migrates seamlessly. Reduced operational overhead - you no longer need to maintain a massive array of databases, clusters, and other infrastructure to host your simple PWA. Instead, a user can visit your DWA, plug in their DWN, and get to work.What‚Äôs Next?If you‚Äôd like to try upgrading your PWA to a DWA or building your own from the ground-up, you can use our web5.js library to interface with DWNs and DIDs. Additionally, you can find support on your developer journey by joining our Discord channel or by engaging in our GitHub page.Tags:Decentralized IdentityPWADWANewer PostTBD partners with Benri to host the SSI ConsoleOlder PostDecentralized Identity in the Real World2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

To do this I created a simple project to create and store DIDs, and use them to read and write to a DWN using a protocol.I used the DWN SDK to create a standalone DWN, which I called a HomeNode. To create DIDs I looked at the different methods available and chose ION as I could use the ION Tools repo to do all the hard work. With ION Tools and the DWN SDK I then made a separate repo for interacting with the DWN, which I called a HomeNode Manager.To test things out I created two ION-anchored DIDs (anchoring takes some time to complete) and set one of them as the tenant of the DWN. This meant only messages created by and sent to the tenant DID would be accepted by the DWN, even if the other DID was also a tenant. To grant the second DID permission to send a message to the tenant DID, I installed a straightforward protocol to allow this. The protocol allowed a plain text message to be sent to the tenant DID by stipulating the protocol path and schema needed. If the protocol was deleted or reconfigured to stop further messages being written then the existing messages could still be accessed by the tenant. Note, there are other ways to achieve this result such as granting permission directly or perhaps using another DWN to receive messages and syncing them to other personal DWNs. My reflections are that Web5 isn't at all how I thought it would be. It does not involve having to learn a whole new framework and you have an awful lot of freedom to build exactly what you need with your preferred tools. You could even create your own DWN SDK if you really wanted to as it's based on a DIF specification. For me, the main concern is storage and usage of keys for signing and encrypting messages. There are so many aspects to consider and seemingly lots of ways to really mess it up. The people in the TBD Discord patiently put up with a lot of questions I had making this project, they really know their stuff. There is a channel called share-what-you-do-‚ú® where you can post your own projects. I definitely recommend having a go as it really helps pin down exactly what this technology can do for you.My project is available on GitHub if you would like to try it out for yourself (and no doubt code a much better version).Tags:Decentralized Web NodesDecentralized IdentityProtocolCommunityNewer PostWho Really Owns Your Social Media Handles?Older PostAuthentication With Web52023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

over your finances, data, and identity. Decentralized Identity is critical to
our mission. It‚Äôs what puts people in control of their own data. It is the most
private, secure, and user-centric way to facilitate information exchange and
verification online.The Decentralized Identity Foundation
(DIF) is a cooperative community that
shares and advances our vision. We‚Äôre honored to work alongside members like
Spruce, Transmute,
and others on open standards which drive this work forward.
Today we're announcing that we‚Äôve achieved another milestone on that journey.TBD and Spruce are the first implementers to demonstrate full interoperability
for the JSON Web Signature Test Suite. These tests are a major step towards
vendor interoperability. Interop is what allows standard technologies to play
nicely with one another, regardless of the backing vendor implementation.TBD and Spruce now support all
five JWS algorithms
for JSON Web Signature 2020
(Data Integrity Proofs) using
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
for W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
and W3C Verifiable Presentations
(VPs).We can only realize the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we
have networks of Issuers and Verifiers that can produce and consume one
another‚Äôs data. The real power of Decentralized Identity is the controlled
sharing of information directly between individuals and other entities,
which makes interoperability a necessity.More details about the Conformance Test Suite that was developed by members
of DIF and our interoperability test reports can be found here:TBD‚Äôs test results of JWS Test SuiteSpruce‚Äôs test results of JWS Test SuiteAt TBD, we support open standards wherever appropriate, and all of our projects are open source. We know our efforts will only be successful if we work in public with the community. We are grateful to work with folks like Spruce and Transmute in the W3C and DIF. By collaborating on common goals in accordance with our ethos, as this achievement exemplifies, we can accelerate the adoption of Decentralized Identity.Tags:DIFW3CCommunityDecentralized IdentityNewer PostWhat are Verifiable Credentials?Older PostWeb5 Roadmap2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.Tags:Decentralized IdentityPWADWARead MoreDecentralized Identity in the Real WorldMay 15, 2023 ¬∑ 4 min readBobbilee HartmanThe concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years.

To get a better sense of the why behind decentralized identifiers, we‚Äôll discuss the real problems society faces today when it comes to identity, and why DIDs are an enormous practical solution to a pervasive set of problems.Identity‚ÄãWhether or not you consider yourself an ‚Äúonline‚Äù person, there are a million ways we currently identify ourselves. Do you have an email address? That‚Äôs an identity. A driver‚Äôs license? Another one there. A Twitter handle? An Instagram account? A phone number? Check, check, check. There are a seemingly incalculable number of ways we can be identified and reached in today‚Äôs day and age.Today, however, our identities are deeply entangled with services and the companies that own them. Your Twitter handle, for example, is exclusive to Twitter - good luck trying to get the same username on Instagram. Want to view your text messages alongside your Facebook messages with a person? Not happening. Lastly, good luck trying to recover your data if your service of choice suddenly were to shut down. To put it even more simply, Bob may be able to say ‚Äúhi my name is Bob‚Äù on one social network A, but the name ‚ÄúBob‚Äù may be reserved on social network B, preventing him from claiming the same name or handle over there. Moreover, if Bob has been a long time user of music app A and decides one day to migrate to music app B, he‚Äôll need to go through the painful process of migrating all his playlists and songs over to the new service.The Data Problem and Solution‚Äã
So what‚Äôs the fundamental issue DIDs are trying to solve? Simply put, users don‚Äôt own their data - services do - and their identity is fragmented across a host of handles, cards, and more. Ideally, we‚Äôd have a single form of identification with strong authentication and deep ties to data ownership, rather than scattered identities, lost passwords, and data owned by someone else. All of these concerns are valid and, it‚Äôs important to note, not simply hype around a shiny new toy.DIDs solve these problems by coming alongside something called a Decentralized Web Node (DWN). Think of DIDs as the identifiers that will allow you to have a truly universal single sign-on experience, while DWNs are a form of data storage that will permit you to own your data while simultaneously being able to use and enjoy all the same kinds of services you currently do.DIDs are, as the name suggests, decentralized - so they‚Äôre inherently not controlled, operated, or regulated by a centralized authority like our current identifiers are. You can have as many DIDs as you‚Äôd like, but you can also have a main DID act as a controller for your other DIDs to help consolidate or partition data when needed, as well as enforce limitations when appropriate. The implications of both decentralization and a controller paradigm are enormous for a vast number of use cases.Life, Decentralized‚ÄãConsider this: Bob has a single DID that acts as his main identifier, but he wants to detangle his work and personal identities to avoid having everything come into the same inbox on weekends. He creates two new DIDs that are controlled by his main identity, and labels them as ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù and ‚Äúwork.‚Äù All of his work emails, calls, texts, and notifications are connected to his work DID, and he can easily silence that noise come Friday night. He can still authenticate to all of those services and own all of that data through his primary DID since it‚Äôs the controller, but can also easily filter through his data since he‚Äôs filed his work things under a separate DID. On the personal side of things, Bob can sign up for new services every day without worrying about migration because he owns all of his data: the second he signs up for a new service, like a social network, he can grant that app access to the media stored on his DWN and that service can act as a presentation layer for his data. Even better, his employer can also act as a controller on his work DID, allowing them to enforce enterprise requirements while keeping completely siloed from his personal data.In this paradigm, Bob doesn‚Äôt worry about remembering a million passwords or losing his data to a service. The new ‚Äúpassword‚Äù for Bob‚Äôs life is access to his main DID, which is protected by his private keys that can be stored in a number of secure ways, including on a physical drive or in a secure digital wallet. Just as significantly, Bob can keep his personal and work lives separate while allowing there to be appropriate separations of authority over his different data silos.Identity Reinvented‚ÄãSo why do you want a DID? Really, the question is, why do you want to shift to a Web5 paradigm? Because identity portability and data ownership are massive yet silent problems we deal with every day. And how will this shift happen? Through the proliferation and adoption of DIDs, the popularization of DID controller paradigms and DWNs, and the availability of mass-appeal wallets to enable secure usage of DIDs. The general public wouldn‚Äôt ever be expected to have a technical understanding of these concepts, but their proliferation will depend on new and existing apps integrating this tech and presenting it to consumers in an easily-digestable way. We don‚Äôt just have to limit ourselves to imagining using this design to separate personal and work life - we can use it to allow for advanced parental controls, role access, and more.If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on GitHub or join us on Discord.Tags:Web5Decentralized IdentityNewer PostSSI-Service Upgraded With Better Playground UIOlder PostTBD's SSI Service hosted by benri.ioIdentityThe Data Problem and SolutionLife, DecentralizedIdentity Reinvented2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

available here. This upgrade introduces a new playground feature that
allows users to interact more dynamically with their credentials, keys, and
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).The upgraded SSI-Service by TBD hosted @ Benri now provides a more interactive
playground feature that allows users to explore the capabilities of SSI more
effectively. This playground feature is accessible here and provides users with
a more dynamic and engaging console for managing their identity information.The new playground feature enables users to interact with their credentials,
keys, and DIDs more easily and intuitively. Users can create, update, and revoke
their DIDs, and manage their DID documents with ease. They can also create and
manage Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and use them to apply for credentials,
exchange credentials, and manage credential revocations and suspensions.In addition, the playground feature includes a more interactive console for API
interaction, allowing users to test and explore the RESTful API for managing the
SSI service in real-time. The console also provides Swagger docs, which offer
detailed documentation for the SSI-Service's APIs, making it easier for users to
understand how to interact with the platform.Overall, the new playground feature makes it easier and more engaging for users
to explore the power of SSI and take control of their digital identities. The
upgraded SSI-Service provides a secure and decentralized platform for identity
management, and the new playground feature makes it even more accessible and
user-friendly.In conclusion, the upgraded SSI-Service now provides a more interactive
playground feature that allows users to explore the capabilities of SSI more

Users must have an independent existence.Control. Users must control their identities.Access. Users must have access to their own data.Transparency. Systems and algorithms must be transparent.Persistence. Identities must be long-lived.Portability. Information and services about identity must be transportable.Interoperability. Identities should be as widely usable as possible.Consent. Users must agree to the use of their identity.Minimalization. Disclosure of claims must be minimized.Protection. The rights of users must be protected.Since 2016, a lot has happened! There have been a flurry of conventions, discussions, papers, standards, software, and industry wide adoption of technology based on the principles of SSI. The space is at its most mature, and only growing.Block‚Äôs mission is economic empowerment. Historically, this has looked like building products and offering services such as Square, enabling millions of merchants to take payments, manage staff, and conduct business in-store and online, and CashApp, which enables millions, especially the un and under-banked to send, spend, bank, and invest their money (and Bitcoin!). When TBD, a new business unit at Block formed in 2021, we expanded on Block‚Äôs mission, setting out to help create a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity. TBD‚Äôs mission is strongly aligned with the principles of SSI.To facilitate our mission, TBD launched Web5: a decentralized platform that provides a new identity layer for the web to enable decentralized apps and protocols. Web5 takes SSI concepts, standards, and software and provides them as an opinionated bundle to enable all that self sovereignty and digital identity has to offer. What TBD is building for Web5 has a number of components today, and more tomorrow. Among those are the Self Sovereign Identity SDK and Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSI SDK, and SSI Service), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN), and Identity Wallets. At the time of writing, all of these components are under active development. This was an intentional move by the team to adopt an ‚Äòopen-by-default‚Äô model, and include the community in the development of Web5 from the beginning.Here we‚Äôll lay out the vision for a key component of Web5: Self Sovereign Identity. Specifically, how we at TBD are building standards based software in a community towards the goals of SSI and Web5. The two ‚ÄúSSI‚Äù named projects ‚Äî the SSI Service and SSI SDK ‚Äî sit along side Decentralized Web Nodes, Identity Wallets, User Interfaces, and much more ‚Äî but focus on a set of standards-based building blocks of the Web5 stack.Software Mission‚ÄãTBD is developing open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.Open Standards‚ÄãThe vision of SSI is realized via Open Standards. Crucially, these standards are accessible to all: to view and to contribute. You may not be aware of it, but you interact with Open Standards every day: whether via web browsers, hardware you use and their underlying protocols, programming languages, audio files, internet and bluetooth devices, text documents, chat applications, encryption you use and so much more. Open Standards facilitate nearly every aspect of modern computation.In the SSI space there a number of standards bodies that facilitate SSI-standard development. Though we may utilize specifications in multiple organizations such as the IETF, OpenID Foundation, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). TBD‚Äôs focus thus far has been primarily with the W3C and DIF organizations:The W3C‚ÄãThe W3C, founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994, is one of the most prominent international standards organizations for the web. The W3C has a number of group types. Community Groups are the most open. The Credentials Community Group focused on Verifiable Credentials, and often serves as a staging ground for the Verifiable Credentials Working Group, responsible for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model (i.e. the Verifiable Credentials specification). The Decentralized Identifier Working Group is responsible for Decentralized Identifiers (i.e. the DID specification).TBD is a member of the W3C, actively utilizes the work items from all three groups, and has made contributions to each group‚Äôs corpus.The Decentralized Identity Foundation‚ÄãThe Decentralized Identity Foundation, or DIF, was founded in 2017 to focus on Decentralized Identity. Since then, it‚Äôs expanded to house a number of working groups around Identifiers, Claims & Credentials, Sidetree, Secure Data Storage, Wallet Security, Interoperability, and more. DIF produces technical specifications, reference implementations (as in the case of Sidetree and ION), and coordinates standards and software implementations for players across the industry.TBD is a member of DIF, regularly attends working groups, contributing to both interoperability projects, specifications, and technical implementations.Standards in Use‚ÄãThe set of standards we rely on and use for Web5 is unbound. However, we have a good sense of the standards we begin with. The list below will likely soon be out of date. Consider it as a reference as you orient yourself with what we‚Äôre working with.SpecificationStandards BodyDescriptionStatusDID CoreW3C Decentralized Identifier Working GroupDecentralized Identifiers v1.0.RecommendationDID IONDIF SidetreeA layer 2 Decentralized Identifier network that runs atop the Bitcion blockchain, built on the Sidetree protocol.Ratified SpecificationDID KeyW3C CCGA simple method to create a DID using a single cryptographic key.Unofficial DraftDID WebW3C CCGA DID method that allows bootstrapping trust using a web domain.W3C Internal DocumentDID PeerDIF Identifiers & DiscoveryA DID method that can be used independent of any central source of truth, intended to be ‚Äúcheap, fast, scalable, and secure.‚ÄùDraftVerifiable Credentials Data ModelW3C Verifiable Credentials Working GroupThe Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1.RecommendationData IntegrityW3C Verifiable Credentials Working GroupDescribes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of structured digital documents‚Ä¶such as digital signatures.Editor‚Äôs DraftJSON Web Signature 2020W3C Verifiable Credentials Working GroupA cryptographic suite for the purpose of creating and verifying proofs for JSON Web Signatures using Linked Data Proofs.Editor‚Äôs DraftVerifiable Credentials JSON SchemaW3C CCGA mechanism to use JSON schemas to back a Verifiable Credential.DraftStatus List 2021W3C CCGA privacy-preserving, space-efficient, and high-performance mechanism for publishing status information such as suspension or revocation of Verifiable Credentials.Draft Community Group ReportVC Proof Format Test SuiteDIF Claims & CredentialsA test suite providing interoperability testing and reporting for Verifiable Credentials and Presentation for Linked Data and JWT signature types.Unofficial DraftPresentation ExchangeDIF Claims & CredentialsA claim format and transport envelope agnostic format for Verifiers to articulate proof requirements, and for Holders to describe proofs according to those requirements.Working Group DraftCredential ManifestDIF Claims & CredentialsA common data format for describing the inputs a Subject must provide to an Issuer for evaluation and issuance of credentials, a means for a Subject to submit an application against those requirements, and a means for an Issuer to fulfill such an application.Pre-DraftTrust EstablishmentDIF Claims & CredentialsA means of communicating trust statements and relations between parties in decentralized identity environments.Pre-DraftDecentralized Web NodeDIF Secure Data StorageA DWN is a data storage and message relay mechanism entities can use to locate public or private permissioned data related to a given DID. DWNs provide multi-node sync, enabling the owning entity to secure, manage, and transact their data with others without centralizing factors.DraftFor brevity, I only included fifteen of the most prominent specifications comprising the foundations of the SSI stack in Web5. There are at least another half dozen either included or planned to be included in our software.TBD Community‚ÄãTBD is interested in building a space for community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access to community resources, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. We are not interested in becoming a standards body itself. Instead, we are focused on fostering a self-sustaining community focused on building and building on Web5. To facilitate this, we can expand our existing tools like adding sections of our Forums, creating new Discord channels, creating new purpose-specific GitHub repositories and investing in new tools for collaboration like an ideas board, job listing page, or a Web5 wiki. I‚Äôd love to see a Web5 incubator similar to Y Combinator that facilitates those building on Web5. The future‚Äôs possibilities are endless, and we are eager to adapt to the evolving needs of the community.Sometimes, we may need more rigorous structure. As such, we are interested in forming working groups in the Web5 community where it makes sense. The output of these groups could be industry coordination, use-case building, software development, or even standards-related work that can be contributed to existing standards bodies. TBD has kicked off one such group to date around Credentials, first focused on creating a path for Know Your Customer (KYC) Credentials. This group already follows such a pattern: having built out use-case documentation in GitHub, having a purpose-specific Discord channel, and forum category. Soon we‚Äôll adapt this group to a more ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù-style format, allowing anyone in the community to show off their work, ask for assistance, and help shape our project development roadmaps. Today we have one GitHub org, run by the TBD team. We will open up roles for community management. Creating light processes for community-driven moderation and maintenance (e.g. managing pull requests, issues, labels, and milestones), in addition to having projects and repositories started and managed entirely by members of the community. One such idea we are considering is for a new GitHub organization for the ‚ÄúWeb5 Community‚Äù to foster and highlight community-driven efforts. We‚Äôre additionally looking to launch an Incubation program that gives a formal path towards recognizing and promoting the work that begins in a grassroots manner in our community. We plan on making the rest of our tooling community-driven as well: today this means Discord and the Forums, tomorrow it will be a lot more!While this is something we are focused on internally, it is crucial that you as community members are able to make suggestions, plans, and directly influence change. Reach out on Discord, our Forums, gain mindshare for your ideas, and we will help make them a reality.Open Source‚ÄãThe foundations of Web5 are open source. This means that its source code is publicly available and, as stewards, we rely on external contribution‚ÄîWeb5 is only successful with the full innovation of a global community. Certainly there are cases where code cannot be open source for various reasons: this applies to the TBD business as well as members of our community. We do not mandate open source, but it is a guiding principle. We believe in the power of open, and all that comes with it. The more open Web5 can be, the better it will be.Projects in the TBD GitHub may originate at TBD, or through the community (on our Discord, Forums). Today, the TBD team is acting as the primary steward and maintainer of all projects. As the community matures, we expect it to take the lead and for TBD to assume a higher-level maintainer role. We imagine this ends up looking like more community-driven projects, community members gaining merge and moderation access, and growing a diverse set of contributors interested in a broad set of use cases to be built on Web5. More broadly, we want to push forward to a world where TBD does not have the only, or final say on any Web5 decision: decentralization is a strength in the development of Web5.This transition is only made possible by active engagement from the community. It is the reason our code is open, and we have set up avenues for engagement. We look towards the community to engage with TBD and others, and push for the future we wish to see built.Software Vision‚ÄãTBD is fostering a set of community-driven, open source, standards-based software to facilitate Self Sovereign Identity on Web5.We want to realize the vision of the Web5 community: to build pragmatic standards-based software that serves a wide variety of needs. The software shall not be tied to any specific entity, nor, without good reason, exclude possibilities within the SSI space. Balancing both feature-richness and complexity we must work closely with our users to design software that meets the needs of all who wish to be on Web5. We think in terms of toolkits, composed of the purpose-specific tools in them. These toolkits exist in a hierarchy of abstractions from which powerful, intuitive, and human-centric software can be built.The software must be designed in a flexible, modular manner. This means interfaces that feature a default implementation or two, but can be extended to facilitate integration into many systems (e.g. swapping out databases, encryption methods, credential formats as needed). The software is intended to be built on open standards in the SSI space. The standards space is fast-changing and there may be cases where we use ill-defined and ill-supported standards; we must be able to favor practicality and working implementations over robust standards with a commitment to see the standards through. There may be cases where we use our software to innovate past the current state of these standards and open the opportunity to contribute back to existing standards and standards bodies.We recognize that the SSI ecosystem is full of competing and developing standards. Often this can feel like developing against a set of moving targets and promises of feature sets. There‚Äôs a lot of information to grok and everyone has an opinion‚Äîthis is a good thing! It can be difficult to pick winners, and even more difficult to choose between multiple standards that appear to do the same thing: we do not want to create a Swiss Army knife that contains five different types of scissors, we‚Äôd rather it contain one (or maybe two) scissors that get the job done well 99% of the time. We favor evaluating the addition of features and standards on a case-by-case basis, and looking towards implementations of standards and features that are well-reasoned, with committed developers. Bonus points if there is already demonstrated usage and interoperability.We also recognize that the SSI ecosystem uses a wide set of tools, languages, and technologies: working across web browsers, mobile applications, backend servers, ledgers, and more. For languages we‚Äôve started with Go (for the SSI SDK and SSI Service) because of its robust cryptographic support, speed, ability to be compiled to WASM, and, above all else, simplicity. It is crucial that the code we write is approachable to encourage contribution. Simple and clear is always preferred over clever. The future is multi-language, and multi-platform. We welcome initiatives for improving multi-language and multi-platform support, and are open to fostering them into our GitHub organization.SSI SDK‚ÄãNamed ssi-sdk, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related to Self Sovereign Identity. The ssi-sdk intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.Primarily, the SDK serves to support Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials and their associated standards. Interacting with Decentralized Identifiers: resolving identifiers, signing, verifying, encrypting, and decrypting data using cryptographic keys found in DID Documents. Interacting with Verifiable Credentials: creating and using data schemas, facilitating credential application, issuance, and exchange.The SDK is an active work in progress, and can be found on the TBD GitHub.SSI Service‚ÄãThe Self Sovereign Identity Service (SSIS) facilitates all things relating to DIDs and Verifiable Credentials ‚Äî in a box! The service is a part of a larger Decentralized Web Platform architecture. The SSI Service is a JSON-API web service that wraps the ssi-sdk to facilitate user-focused interactions on Web5. The service is intended to interact with user interfaces, wallets, decentralized web nodes, and other web infrastructure. By taking the lower-level building blocks exposed by the SDK, the service is intended to drastically lower the barrier to entry for any individual or organization interesting in building on the Web5 stack. Like the SDK, it is agnostic to any specific business or use case, and design to be pluggable into external infrastructure whether existing or new. The service is assumed to be run by a single organization and assumes external authentication and authorization. The service assumes no infrastructure requirements and is flexible to multiple deployment models, databases, key management solutions, and user interfaces. We expect that a wide array of users and use cases will use and build on top of the service, creating layers of abstraction and intermediation for processing business logic, handling user accounts, and so on.The service is an active work in progress, and can be found on the TBD GitHub.How Features are Developed‚ÄãWe are in the early days of Web5. By intention, we‚Äôve announced our ideas and projects way before they are ready for an alpha release, let alone inclusion in a production-ready application. Transparency is an asset in sharing our thinking and gaining mindshare for what we are building. As such, there are many forks in the road fast-approaching. To move past these forks, and the forks after those I introduce some light process to guide principled decision making:Features shall be developed using the Socratic method: making statements, interrogating them, asking whys and hows, being intellectually honest with risk, uncertainty, consider second, third and n-order effects.All new feature proposals shall include a light design document outlining desired functionality, end-user utility, prior art, room for improvement and next steps, risks and mitigations, considerations, and open questions.A quorum of project maintainers shall review and progress feature proposals in a timely manner.Templates for the aforementioned process have been created on each GitHub repository. I encourage you to create GitHub issues and Forum discussions to explore thinking, and revise designs before going forth with a contribution.For templates on feature development, philosophies on versioning and releases, and more information view our GitHub documentation: SSI Service GitHub Docs | SSI SDK GitHub DocsThe Goal‚ÄãI believe in setting public and ambitious measurable goals. This serves as a powerful self-discipline mechanism, as well as a call to action for forward progress. Officially the timeline for Web5 can be found on our site. Unofficially, here is my ambition:By January 1st 2023 the following shall be true:The first beta release of the SSI SDK and SSI Service (0.1.0) will be released.Each SSI project will have >75% test coverage.Each project will have robust user and developer documentation with clear examples.The SSI SDK will have feature complete specification implementations for at least all fifteen standards identified above.The SSI Service will be deployable in an infrastructure-agnostic manner, demonstrated on ‚â• 2 platforms.The SSI Service will facilitate practical end-user flows facilitating:Creating and managing DIDs using ‚â• 2 DID methodsCreating and issuing Verifiable Credentials backed by JSON schemasCreating Credential Manifests, accepting Credential Applications, and fulfilling Credential ApplicationsCreating Presentation Definitions, sending Presentation Requests, and accepting Presentation SubmissionsCreating Credential Revocations and checking Credentials against themCreating and processing Trust Establishment documentsThe SSI SDK and Service will support the Decentralized Web Node specification and the Service will work with at least one DWN.Parting Thoughts‚ÄãYou should now have a pretty good sense of how we conceive of SSI software on Web5, and how its journey will unfold. Most importantly the mission is not TBD‚Äôs alone, it is that of the community. We build real software for real people and favor pragmatism above all else. What I‚Äôve written here is current thinking and is always subject to evolution‚Äîwith your help. I‚Äôm looking forward to you joining us in pushing SSI and Web5 forward, gaining new perspectives, solving new use-cases, and building some cool shit.Tags:Self Sovereign IdentityWeb5Newer PostAnnouncing the Incubation ProgramOlder PostWhat are Verifiable Credentials?Software MissionOpen StandardsThe W3CThe Decentralized Identity FoundationStandards in UseTBD CommunityOpen SourceSoftware VisionSSI SDKSSI ServiceHow Features are DevelopedThe GoalParting Thoughts2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

With Web5, traditional authentication methods are no longer the sole means of verifying identity and ownership. Instead, users can leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to establish their digital presence while retaining full control over their data. Let's explore how this revolutionizes authentication and content ownership as we know it.Tags:Decentralized IdentityDecentralized Web NodesRead MorePractical Applications of Decentralized Identifiers - Parental ControlsJune 7, 2023 ¬∑ 6 min readChris GiglioRecently on the blog we talked about why decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a practical solution to real problems. In that post we discussed some high-level concepts behind how and why DIDs could solve many of the identity and data problems we face today, but today let‚Äôs dive deep on a specific problem set DIDs could solve: parental controls and minors‚Äô digital security.It‚Äôs an inescapable reality for parents today that their kids will be online. There‚Äôs no avoiding the reality that minors are going to consume a diverse array of content and interact with others on the internet, but parents do want to have a say in what‚Äôs put in front of their children. Digital safety is already incorporated by some services - such as Netflix - and platforms - like iOS - but universal parental controls and safety monitoring don‚Äôt presently exist. That could change, however, via DIDs and a concept known as DID controllers.Tags:Decentralized IdentityDID ControllerRead MoreTBD partners with Benri to host the SSI ConsoleJune 1, 2023 ¬∑ 2 min readAndor KesselmanIn the realm of digital identity, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) empowers

PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.Tags:Decentralized IdentityPWADWARead MoreDecentralized Identity in the Real WorldMay 15, 2023 ¬∑ 4 min readBobbilee HartmanThe concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years.

Is it a driver's license, passport,  birth certificate, college degree, state ID? The common thread of these forms of credentials is that they are physical items, verified by recognized centralized bodies like a government agency or accredited university.  So how do credentials translate into the digital world where within a few clicks someone can make a fictitious identity?

PWAs take advantage of native features such as on-device storage, push notifications, and even windowing without requiring the overhead of a native app and the ability to install them without going through an app store. In the same way that HTML5 and PWAs changed the way users expected to consume their apps through the minor addition of manifest, an even larger shift has arrived in the form of Decentralized Web Apps (DWAs), which combine PWAs with Web5. While PWAs redefined the relationship between the client and server by enabling richer on-device experiences through native integrations, DWAs are going to completely redefine data storage for apps resulting in a seismic shift in user privacy, ease-of-use, and data portability.Tags:Decentralized IdentityPWADWARead More2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

It‚Äôs the very nature of Web2 infrastructure that platforms like TikTok absorb an incredible amount of ownership and responsibility to store, manage, and steward the relationships and data on them, putting end users and businesses at risk.So what‚Äôs the alternative? How can we build platforms that turn over data ownership to the users of that platform rather than hoard massive amounts of power? The answer is to build Web5 applications that enable users to maintain ownership of their data so platforms can stick to what they do best: curating and serving that data.Let‚Äôs consider the model a platform like TikTok currently uses. They ask users to upload videos to TikTok servers and then store, sort, organize, and serve that content. In a Web5 world, users could store their own videos on their own decentralized web node(s) and grant access to that content to TikTok. TikTok would adhere to a common schema to access that content - one that any other platform, such as Facebook or Instagram could access as well, and then layer its own metadata such as likes, comments, and analytics on top of that.Follower counts wouldn‚Äôt need to be limited to a single platform, instead allowing users with a single decentralized identifier to follow users, creators, or businesses across platforms. This would decouple platforms and distribution, meaning that the marketing power of individuals and businesses wouldn‚Äôt be wholly subject to the whim of community guidelines or editorial discretion of platform owners. In this model, a TikTok ban would simply mean that TikTok‚Äôs metadata - like counts, comments, and other analytics - would be stripped away, but the content and creator-follower relationships would persist. TikTok and platforms like it would still be able to curate their excellent algorithms, monetize on in-feed ads, and more, while holding less power over their users‚Äô content and reducing the overhead of storing incredibly large amounts of video content on behalf of their users.If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on GitHub or join us on Discord.Tags:Web5Social MediaNewer PostTBD's SSI Service hosted by benri.ioOlder PostWeb Assembly with ChatGPT2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Is it a driver's license, passport,  birth certificate, college degree, state ID? The common thread of these forms of credentials is that they are physical items, verified by recognized centralized bodies like a government agency or accredited university.  So how do credentials translate into the digital world where within a few clicks someone can make a fictitious identity? Introducing... verifiable credentials (VCs), a digitally signed electronic credential that follows an open standard that lets you create, own, and manage your credentials across a variety of platforms.Why Do We Need Verifiable Credentials?‚ÄãOver the course of your digital history, you've likely signed up for hundreds of apps and services with elements of your personal data fragmented, such as your name, email address, or more sensitive information like your date of birth and government ID number. These services then share your data with other third parties that you may not even be aware of - with or without your consent. It's difficult to go back and deactivate your profiles, delete your accounts, or reclaim additional data these services have collected on you. Worse is if there is a data breach in one of these services and now your data is out in the public.Verifiable Credentials aim to solve these problems by putting the power to manage your data back into your hands. Imagine being able to own and control your personal data by only allowing access to services that require it and having the authority to disable services that no longer need it. You can even manage your data on your own self-hosted decentralized web node via an identity hub without relying on any centralized third party. Additionally, you can own multiple Verifiable Credentials for various use cases such as a student ID, a driver's license, a passport, or a certificate you earned. You can also have one specific Verifiable Credential with multiple presentation layers such as a passport where certain metadata is presented when used in a given context.How Do Verifiable Credentials Work?‚ÄãYou may be wondering who actually issues a Verifiable Credential, how does it get verified and who verifies the verifier? Let's look at the following example of the manual way credentials are issued. You've been accepted to your top university of choice and now need a student ID to access both the campus and online resources. Specifically, you want to apply for a campus parking permit as well. Typically this process would involve you taking physical copies of multiple forms of ID verification such as a passport, birth certificate, and driver's license to a physical office. Then after a few days of various checks, you're finally issued a physical student ID card from that university. The university trusts the entity that issued your birth certificate, passport, and driver's license to create a student ID for you. They can even look you up by the identification numbers on these documents. But what if someone in the admissions office looked up your driver's license and noticed those parking tickets you have? Were they even allowed to do so and could this bias their decision to give you a parking permit?The current process looks something like this:Now let‚Äôs look at how verifiable credentials could help in this scenario. The university would run verification checks for each document provided (passport, driver‚Äôs license, birth certificate, etc) and the credential would be limited to just basic bio data that is required such as a legal name, date of birth, etc. So no one from the student department will be able to see your ticketing history associated with your driver‚Äôs license.Using Verified Credentials‚ÄãDecentralized identifiers (DIDs) work alongside Verifiable Credentials. DIDs are unique identifiers that let us reference various VCs and the entities that also issue those credentials. For example a government or company can have their own unique DID. DIDs use the following schema:
photo credit: W3CDIDs can then be used to create a Verified Credential by digitally signing it and assigning it to a holder, similar to how transactions are cryptographically signed in a blockchain. Depending on the signature format of the credential, the holder (also known as a DID subject) can then choose how much of that credential they want to present to an entity requesting the credential, which is referred to as selective disclosure. An example is an employer, Company X, who looks up the DID of your college diploma from University Y. Company X queries the issuer of your Diploma Verifiable Credential, in this case University Y, and also looks up the DID of that university in a verifiable data registry (VDR). Think of VDRs as just lists that can be managed and maintained by various parties such as wallets, financial institutions, DAOs, non-profits, etc. If your credentials have valid digital signatures but somehow University Y is on a list of non-accredited institutions in the USA but accredited institutions in Europe, it would be up to the Company X to decide if they want to accept it.The diagram below outlines the flow of this process.
photo credit: W3CUse Cases for Verifiable Credentials‚ÄãThere are several use cases that can be realized with the use of Verifiable Credentials, such asEmployment checks without being invasive Managing of health records, land titles, etcManaging of various forms of personal identification such as passports, driver‚Äôs licenses, etc KYC (Know Your Customer) checks for financial institutions and businessesManaging your gamer profile across different metaversesManaging MembershipsDIDs and VCs allow us to create identities and credentials in an interoperable ecosystem that allow developers and businesses to build a new wave of products, applications, and services that put users in control.Tags:Verifiable CredentialsDecentralized IdentityNewer PostSelf Sovereign Identity, TBD, and Web5Older PostOur Interoperability Work in the Decentralized Identity FoundationWhy Do We Need Verifiable Credentials?How Do Verifiable Credentials Work?Using Verified CredentialsUse Cases for Verifiable Credentials2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

They are given accounts by companies and their data is held captive in app silos. To create a new class of decentralized apps and protocols that put individuals at the center, we must empower them with self-owned identity and restore control over their data.Components of Web 5‚ÄãThere are three main pillars of the decentralized web platform, all of which are based on open standards.Decentralized Identifiers‚ÄãThe identifiers we know and use today are owned by the government, a company, an organization, or some other intermediary. For example, our email addresses and social media handles are identifiers associated with us but are owned and controlled by the service providers. These companies have the right to ban, disable, or delete these identifiers and we have little to no control over this.So before we can realize truly decentralized applications, we need decentralized identifiers that users own and control. This removes the dependency on centralized entities to authenticate and represent us.‚Äã‚ÄãDecentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a W3C standard. They have a standardized structure that essentially links to you and your information.They are a long string of text that consists of three parts:the URI scheme identifier, which is didthe identifier for a DID methodthe DID method-specific identifierStoring DIDs on ION (a Layer 2 DID network that runs on top of Bitcoin) is a preferred design decision for the implementation of Web 5. ION is a decentralized replacement for DNS for identity identifiers, so there are no authorities, coordinators, tokens, or other centralized bottleneck.DIDs are the only component of Web5 that touch a blockchain, which is generally limited to anchoring the keys/endpoints linked to the ID.That being said, anchoring DIDs on Bitcoin (or any blockchain) is not a requirement. In fact, what's great about having the standardized formatting for DIDs is that they can be anchored anywhere or not anchored at all and this still works, although with varying levels of decentralization.Here are examples of DIDs on the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the web. Notice they all use the same format: scheme, DID method, and DID method-specific identifier.did:btcr:xyv2-xzpq-q9wa-p7tdid:ens:some.ethdid:web:example.comBecause personal data is not stored on the blockchain, the DID essentially acts as a URI that associates the subject of the DID (the person, company, or object being identified) with a DID document that lives off-chain.DID Documents are JSON files stored in decentralized storage systems such as IPFS, and describe how to interact with the DID subject. The DID Document contains things like the DID subject's public keys, authentication and verification methods, and service endpoints that reference the locations of the subject‚Äôs data.{  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",  "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",  "verificationMethod": [    {      "id": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8",      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",      "controller": "did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"    }  ],  "authentication": ["did:ion:EiClkZMDxPKqC9c-umQfTkR8"]}Verifiable Credentials‚ÄãVerifiable Credentials are a fully ratified W3C standard that work hand in hand with Decentralized Identifiers to enable trustless interactions - meaning two parties do not need to trust one another to engage, but claims made about a DID subject can be verified.For example, Alice needs to prove she has a bank account at Acme Bank. Acme Bank issues a cryptographically signed Verifiable Credential which would be stored in Alice's identity wallet.The credential contains the issuer as Acme and the subject as Alice, as well as the claims, which are Alice's account number and full name.Upon request for proof of banking, Alice presents the Verifiable Credential that's cryptographically signed by both Alice as well as her bank.This is an easy, machine-readable way to share credentials across the web. The Verifier does not know or trust Alice, but they do consider Acme trustworthy, and they have essentially vouched for Alice therefore distributing trust.Decentralized Web Nodes‚ÄãToday, centralized entities act as our data stores. Applications hold all of our content and preferences on their servers.Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs) change this by allowing us to decouple our data from the applications that we use, and instead host our data ourselves in our own personal data stores.BlueSky is a good example; it's a decentralized version of Twitter that's in the works. With BlueSky, your tweets and your connections aren't stored with the application. They are stored with you. So you can present your content on any decentralized social media app you want, not just BlueSky.Your DWNs can hold both public and encrypted data. For example, in the case of a decentralized version of Twitter, you'd want data like your tweets and your connections to be public but things like your DMs to be private.Your decentralized web nodes do not live on the blockchain. You can host your web nodes anywhere (your phone, computer, etc) and can replicate them across your devices and clouds and all data will be synced.While self-hosting your DWNs provides a means for decentralizing your data, we recognize some users will be more comfortable with others hosting their web nodes for convenience sake. We envision there will be vendors offering to host your web nodes for you. The good part about that is you can encrypt any private data so unlike today where cloud hosts can scan everything that you host there, you can still maintain some privacy even if you have your web nodes hosted by intermediaries.Your DWNs are associated with your Decentralized Identifiers and are listed in a DID document.Notice the serviceEndpoint section of the DID doc specifies service endpoints and provides URIs to the decentralized web nodes.{  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",  "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",  "service": [    {      "id": "#dwn",      "type": "DecentralizedWebNode",      "serviceEndpoint": {        "nodes": ["https://dwn.example.com", "00:11:22:33:FF:EE"]      }    }  ],  "verificationMethod": [    {      "id": "did:web:example.com:u:alice",      "type": "Secp256k1VerificationKey2018",      "controller": "did:web:example.com:u:alice"    }  ],  "authentication": ["did:web:example.com:u:alice"]}Given an application has the address to your DWN, they can send you a request for data.This represents a request from an application to obtain all objects within a DWN that follow the SocialMediaPosting schema:    POST https://dwn.example.com/    BODY {      "requestId": "c5784162-84af-4aab-aff5-f1f8438dfc3d",      "target": "did:example:123",      "messages": [        {          "descriptor": {            "method": "CollectionsQuery",            "schema": "https://schema.org/SocialMediaPosting"          }        },        {...}      ]    }The data within DWNs are JSON objects that follow a universal standard, thus making it possible for any application to discover and process the data given its semantic type.If this data is public, those objects will be automatically returned to the application, and if the data is private, the node owner would need to grant the application access to that data.Identity Wallets‚ÄãObviously all of this is pretty complicated, especially for non-technical users. So we need a simplistic, easy to use interface that will allow people to access and manage their identity.A well designed identity wallet would provide ways to manage the data stored in decentralized web nodes, the decentralized IDs and the context in which they should be used, verifiable credentials, and authorizations.Decentralized Web Apps‚ÄãWeb 5 enables developers to build decentralized web applications (DWAs) on top of it and it‚Äôs all open source! You're free to use it as your foundation and focus your attention on what you really care about, your app. Web5 brings to DWAs what cloud and application servers bring to enterprise apps. It does the hard part. It brings decentralization. By building your apps on top of Web 5, you get decentralization and identity and data management as part of the platform.This is definitely a fundamental change in how we exchange data, but it's not a total overhaul of the web we already know. This works like Progressive Web Apps, but you'd add the decentralized web node SDK and then applications are free to really go serverless because the data isn't stored with them.The sky's the limit to what you can build on top of this platform, but here are some cool basic examples.Music Applications‚ÄãNo one likes recreating their music playlists over and over again for different apps. With Web 5, you wouldn't have to do that.In this example, Groove has access to write to Alice's decentralized web node and adds a new entry.Tidal has access to read from Alice's DWN, so can read the new entry that was added by Groove, and now Alice has her playlist readily available on both apps.With the continuous utilization of the data across apps, not only do Groove and Tidal get access to Alice's data, but they use it to improve her user experience, thus creating a stronger experience than Alice could have ever gotten had she not used this tech.Travel Applications‚ÄãYour travel preferences, tickets, and reservations are scattered across so many different hotels, airlines, rental car agencies and travel apps, making it really difficult to coordinate. Heaven forbid there's any hiccup in the system such as a delayed flight. You end up trying to get in touch with the car rental place to let them know you'll be late for your reservation, and if it's really late, you'd want to call the hotel to ask them not to give away your room. All while you're hustling and bustling at the airport.Web 5 can help unify these various app experiences.If Alice gives the hotel, the airline, and the rental car agency access to the Reservation and Trip objects in her DWN, they can react and adjust accordingly to any changes made.These are just a few applications that can be realized by building on top of Web 5. There's so many more possibilities once the web is truly decentralized the way it was always intended to be.How to Get Involved‚ÄãWhile we‚Äôre super excited about this technology, there's still lots of problems to be solved. We welcome you to join us in making the web we all deserve.Check out our GitHub projects, if you‚Äôd like to see more or contribute to the components.We have open job reqs if you‚Äôre interested in formally working on decentralized technologies.If you're a company who is trying to solve these same challenges or could make use of any of these components, we'd love to collaborate.If you‚Äôd like to join the community, we‚Äôre on Discord.Tags:web5Newer PostWeb5 RoadmapComponents of Web 5Decentralized IdentifiersVerifiable CredentialsDecentralized Web NodesIdentity WalletsDecentralized Web AppsMusic ApplicationsTravel ApplicationsHow to Get Involved2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

I'm frequently asked why major companies, who have made billions of dollars off of our data, would buy into this model.I challenge you to think of this from a different perspective. In the ever-evolving technological landscape, Web5 is not a call to convince the giants to relinquish control over our data, but about expanding what's possible on the web.A decentralized app model might not immediately grab the attention of today's market leaders, but it opens up exciting possibilities for the innovators of tomorrow, particularly around open data models.The Incentive‚ÄãWeb5 enables a web that eliminates the traditional barriers of centralized data control. Developers who resonate with this philosophy, or those intrigued by the many advantages of a decentralized approach, will find Web5 to be a vast playground.Let's take AI-driven applications as an example. Through today's lens, it may appear that data equates to unparalleled value and thus, retaining control of that data would be attractive. However, as AI technologies evolve, they increasingly depend on rich, diverse, and open datasets ‚Äî the kind that are best obtained by participating in a more open, decentralized data ecosystem.But this shift isn't limited to AI. Web5 creates an ideal setting for innovation for all sorts of companies from many different verticals. Up-and-coming apps, unburdened by legacy systems and the status quo, can fully embrace the benefits of Web5, paving the way for a new era of web applications. This unique advantage allows them to immediately offer something that top companies don't: the ability for users to take their data with them.Consumer Expectations‚ÄãHere‚Äôs where things get interesting. As early adopters interact with and understand the value of applications built on Web5, their demands will shift. They'll start to expect more portability and interoperability of their data between applications across the web. In time, this change in expectations will exert pressure even on larger players to adapt or offer similar flexibility.We‚Äôve seen this unfold with products like Google Search and StackOverflow in the wake of ChatGPT. These players have dominated their respective markets for quite some time. Not even a year ago, the thought of a new app threatening these business models seemed improbable... comical even. And yet, almost overnight, we saw consumers‚Äô expectations change. All of a sudden, asking a question and clicking through multiple links to get to the answer felt outdated. Dealing with snarky users in order to get technical help no longer seemed worth the trouble.This new expectation forced these companies, who are the market leaders in their spaces, to reassess their business models and innovate accordingly in order to appease their user base.The Journey to Adoption‚ÄãHere‚Äôs how I envision the journey of Web5 adoption.Evolution‚ÄãIt‚Äôs worth emphasizing that Web5 isn‚Äôt about replacing the old with the new, but an invitation to explore a new application model. It's about enabling a world where data isn't hoarded, but shared, and where developers can create applications free of traditional restraints.In this unfolding story of the web's evolution, it's not the dominant players who will dictate the narrative. Instead, the stage is set for those who see beyond the status quo, for applications that redefine what's possible, and for consumers who champion their own data rights.Web5 is less about disruption and more about evolution; the future awaits those brave enough to embrace it.Tags:Web5Newer PostExciting News!

If you don't see a project here that you're interested in, Check out our other repos here.Developer WebsiteWeb5-JSSSI-ServiceSSI-SDKSSI-PlaygroundSSI-admin-uiDWN-ServerDWN-SDK-JSContributing Code Snippets‚ÄãIf you're working on tutorials or guides of any sort, we have a Code Snippet system that allows us to update the code in one place but also allows it to be runnable and tested.Here are some steps on how you'd make a Code Snippet:We have to make updates in 3 places per Code Snippet.The code snippet itself will go in the code-snippets directory. We make code snippets based on the page.So if you're making a code snippet for the api/web5-js/protocols.md page, you'd make a file at api/web5-js/protocols.js and put the code snippet in there.
If you wanted to make a code snippet specifically for the web5-js index page, you'd name it index.js. So the path to the code snippet would be code-snippets/api/web5-js/index.js. Note: 
Your code snippet should be within a function block. The function block is how we name the code snippet. We only display what's in the body of the function block, minus the return statement.For example:function codeSnippetFunctionName() {  // Your code snippet goes here  const result = Web5.connect();  return result;}It's important to make your function name as specific as possible, because it will be used to reference the code snippet in the code-snippets.json file. Duplicate names will overwrite one another.(We should probably come up with an agreed upon naming convention)Under the hood, a script will run called extract-code-snippets which will add your code snippet to the code-snippets.json file. This file is used to reference your code snippet within the <CodeSnippet /> component.The second update you'll make would be on the content page itself. Add the following snippet where you'd like the code snippet to exist:<CodeSnippet functionName="codeSnippetFunctionName" />The CodeSnippet component will look for the function name you provided in the code-snippets.json file and render the code snippet. If the name doesn't exist it will display an error instead.Write tests for the code snippet.Below is an example test file.The file path should match the same path as both code snippet and the actual content:__tests__/code-snippets/api/web5-js/protocols.test.js would be the path for the protocols example above.import { test, beforeAll, expect, describe } from 'vitest';import { Web5 } from '@web5/api/browser';// import your functions from your codesnippet fileimport {  queryMusicProtocol,  queryProtocolDescending,  configureProtocolWithDefinition,} from '../../../code-snippets/api/web5-js/protocols';let web5;let record;let myDid;beforeAll(async () => {  const result = await Web5.connect();  web5 = result.web5;  myDid = result.did;});// example of what real tests look like for the protocols.js filedescribe('tests for /api/web5-js/dwn/protocols.js', () => {  test('queryMusicProtocol', async () => {    //this calls the function that returns the code snippet    const { protocols, status } = await queryMusicProtocol(web5);    // expect.soft() will note any failures if they occur but will continue running the test    expect.soft(protocols).toBeDefined();    expect(status.code).toBe(200);  });  test('configureProtocolWithDefinition', async () => {    const { protocol, status } = await configureProtocolWithDefinition(      web5,      myDid,      protocolDefinition,    );    expect(status.code).toBe(202);  });  test('queryProtocolDescending', async () => {    const { protocols, status } = await queryProtocolDescending(web5);    expect.soft(protocols).toBeDefined();    expect(status.code).toBe(200);  });});Caveats for Code Snippets‚ÄãIt's crucial that the return lines are a single line only. It only hides the return line, but it's still there for testing purposes.These tests are only testing the code snippets. There are more thorough tests that actually test the SDK.License‚ÄãWhen contributing to projects under TBD you agree to license your contributions under Apache License 2.0.Join the CommunityConnect with us everywhere.GitHubSubmit a PR or open an issueViewDiscordEngage with fellow community membersJoinTwitter/XFollow us for news and updatesFollowHow Can You Contribute?Good First IssuesNew Open IssuesContributing Code SnippetsCaveats for Code SnippetsLicense2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

It lets devs focus on creating delightful user experiences, while returning ownership of data and identity to individuals.The following is sometimes called the triangle of trust:
        path.link {stroke:#000;strokeWidth:4;markerEnd: url(#arrow)}

      IssuerIssue credentialHoldersPresent the credentialVerifiersTrust the issuer(can do privacy preserving check)The Issuers are a trusted source of credentials, perhaps issuing passports of drivers licenses, or perhaps a trusted person.
They can use services like the SSI Service or the SSI SDK to create new credentials and issue them to holders. The holder provides their DID to the Issuer, who then decides whether or not to issue a credential to the holder. This is called Issuance.The holders then keep their credentials for later use. The holder can present the credential (as a presentation, or as a JSON or JWT string) to a Verifier.
The Verifier will check that the credential belongs to the holder (via their DID), and that they (the Verifier) trusts the Issuer (via their DID). If they do, they can trust the Holder that they have the qualifications presented to them.The SSI SDK and SSI Service provide utilities for issuing credentials and managing them, and the SSI SDK and (many other) libraries can help you validate presented credentials.üöÄ SSI DocsContributeChat on DiscordUse CasesControl Your IdentityAlice holds a digital wallet that securely manages her identity and credentials.

But money and payments have not kept pace.The legacy payments system is held together with proverbial duct tape that masks fundamental problems: final settlement of payments is slow, expensive, and never quite final. Risks get priced in as expensive account fees ‚Äì or exclusion from the system itself. This hits the most economically disadvantaged the hardest.A decentralized and trustless system like Bitcoin shifts the paradigm to financial access. There are no credit checks or monthly account fees. Open, decentralized, and permissionless networks let you send money anywhere in the world, near instantly.So now we have both legacy payment systems and new payment systems. But how do we get from the old to the new? tbDEX bridges the worlds of legacy money and digital money.tbDEX is a decentralized, permissionless protocol.

100 units of digital currency. Because Alice is off-ramping from digital currency to fiat, most Participating Financial
Institutions(PFIs) are required to verify Alice‚Äôs identity in order to fulfill
their regulatory and compliance obligations. PFIs that are interested in fulfilling
Alice‚Äôs request reply with a bid as well as their identity verification requirements
for fulfillment. Alice chooses a bid which will need Know Your Customer (KYC)
information (such as name, address, date of birth). Alice has already provided all
of the necessary information to another PFI in the past. So, Alice allows her wallet
to provide a verifiable credential issued from the past PFI to the bidding PFI, along with the currency
to exchange. The PFI verifies the credential and continues with fulfillment.2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Agents hold a user's DIDs, private keys, and a DWN, and are permissioned to use the private keys of DIDs to act on a user's behalf to sign and store messages within a DWN. << More on Agents >>Centralized Authority‚ÄãA single entity or organization that has control over the network and its operations, potentially posing a risk to the principles of decentralization and autonomy.Decentralized Identifier (DID)‚ÄãA Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a globally unique identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity, without the need for centralized intermediaries. DIDs are typically implemented using decentralized and distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain, and provide a way to verify and authenticate digital identities, while ensuring privacy and control over personal data. << More on DIDs >>Decentralized Web Node (DWN)‚ÄãA Decentralized Web Node is a personal data store in a decentralized network that stores and shares information, serves as a communication channel, and executes transactions in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized server, thereby enhancing security, privacy, and resilience of the network. << More on DWNs >>DID Document‚ÄãA JSON document containing details about a DID, including the DID itself, represented by an id field, as well as other data related to the verification and authentication methods of the DID.<< More on DID Documents >>DID Method‚ÄãA specific scheme for creating, resolving, updating, and deactivating DIDs and their associated documents, as outlined in a DID method specification which provides detailed instructions on these operations.DID Method - ION‚ÄãThe did:ion method leverages the scalability and security of the Bitcoin blockchain by using off-chain transactions to create and update DIDs, while utilizing on-chain transactions for anchoring and providing proof of the DID's existence and integrity. The did:ion: method aims to provide a secure, scalable, and decentralized solution for managing digital identities that is interoperable with other decentralized identity solutions.DID Method - Key‚ÄãThe did:key method is a simple, lightweight way to create a DID. It is based on a public key, and it is self-contained, meaning it does not rely on any external blockchain or registry. This makes did:key a convenient method for use cases that don't require the complexity and additional features provided by other DID methods.DID Method - Web‚ÄãThe did:web method is a type of Decentralized Identifier (DID) method that enables the creation of DIDs using a web domain name as the unique identifier, allowing for DIDs to be created and managed using existing web infrastructure and technologies, without requiring a specific blockchain or distributed ledger. The method utilizes HTTP(S) URLs to resolve DIDs and provides a flexible and decentralized way to manage digital identities on the web. However, the security and privacy of the did:web: method may depend on the web domain provider and the associated security measures in place.Key Store‚ÄãA digital storage system that securely stores and manages a DID's cryptographic keys and key material, which is used for security protocols such as digital signing and verification.Signature Algorithm‚ÄãA mathematical algorithm used to generate digital signatures. These are used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of electronic documents, messages, or transactions by creating a unique digital signature that can be cryptographically validated.Sidetree Protocol‚ÄãThe Sidetree protocol is a decentralized and blockchain-agnostic protocol that enables the creation and management of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and their associated data off-chain, while utilizing the blockchain as a trust anchor for anchoring DID operations, thereby reducing the load on the blockchain and enhancing scalability.Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)‚ÄãSSI refers to a concept where individuals have full control and ownership over their digital identities. It empowers individuals to manage and control their personal information without relying on centralized authorities or intermediaries. SSI enables individuals to store their personal data and identity in a secure and private manner. With self-sovereign identity, individuals can selectively share their personal information with others, granting access on a need-to-know basis all while maintaining privacy and control over their data.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousAPI Reference GuidesAgentCentralized AuthorityDecentralized Identifier (DID)Decentralized Web Node (DWN)DID DocumentDID MethodDID Method - IONDID Method - KeyDID Method - WebKey StoreSignature AlgorithmSidetree ProtocolSelf Sovereign Identity (SSI)2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Create a Verifiable CredentialSSI Service Setup‚Äãa. Create DID for Credential Issuer (Acme)In the world of SSI, DIDs are used to identify any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.). In this scenario, both Acme (issuer) and Alice (subject) are represented by their DIDs in the VC creation process.We need two pieces of issuer information to create the credential: the issuers DID and a verificationMethod. To get both, let's create a did:key to act as the issuer, with the following PUT command to /v1/dids/key:curl -X PUT -d '{"keyType":"Ed25519"}' localhost:8080/v1/dids/keyinfoEach DID has one or more keys, and each key has a type. Some keytypes give you different properties and can be used for different purposes. Some keys are better for signing, others for encryption. Some are even provided by the government (NIST). There are variations on how they're constructed to give different security properties. You can use any number of DID types but we recommend Ed25519 as it's sufficient for most use cases.The following response should be returned:{  "did": {    "@context": [      "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",      "https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020/v1"    ],    "id": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",    "verificationMethod": [      {        "id": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",        "type": "JsonWebKey2020",        "controller": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",        "publicKeyJwk": {          "kty": "OKP",          "crv": "Ed25519",          "x": "TSP7cqEemLaZPUxbc0UzdjGVDUAfzVuOecBGuDgmqj4",          "alg": "EdDSA",          "kid": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw"        }      },      {        "id": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6LSrEnnMyZnZbaUw9WNvWogpwAdUgnfn4nXxjwaVqYVMDwp",        "type": "JsonWebKey2020",        "controller": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",        "publicKeyJwk": {          "kty": "OKP",          "crv": "X25519",          "x": "2F555fIs2yg-MOAXyR6Cmnr-CVLf9IyDKeNu44ansFs",          "alg": "X25519",          "kid": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw"        }      }    ],    "authentication": [      "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw"    ],    "assertionMethod": [      "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw"    ],    "keyAgreement": [      "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6LSrEnnMyZnZbaUw9WNvWogpwAdUgnfn4nXxjwaVqYVMDwp"    ],    "capabilityInvocation": [      "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw"    ],    "capabilityDelegation": [      "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw"    ]  }}As you can see the DID returned here is using key as its DID method.

Create DID for Credential Subject (Alice)Here's a generic DID you can use for Alice for testing purposes:did:key:z6MkqcFHFXqzsYyDYrEUA2pVCfQGJz2rYoCZy5WWszzSW3o6However, if you'd prefer to create a new DID for Alice, run:curl -X PUT -d '{"keyType":"Ed25519"}' localhost:8080/v1/dids/keyc. Create a Credential SchemaA Credential Schema is a document that defines the structure of a VC. It's based on the json schema and shows which properties the issuer is going to use to create the VC.Because we want to include information about the subject in the credential, let's first create a schema to define the shape of the credential's data with the following values:Set issuer to Acme's DID.Set verificationMethodId to the id property of the first object in the verificationMethod array.The employedAt property is a timestamp data type to define the date and time someone was employed at Acme.Our schema object conforms to the Draft 2020-12 schema version, so set its $schema property to json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema.noteAlthough it is not required to add issuer and verificationMethodId when creating a credential schema, we're adding them in this example to show how you can prove who created the schema, an extra layer of security, and that it's not been tampered with.Once we have our schema, we'll submit it to the service with a PUT request to v1/schemas:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/schemas -d '{  "name": "Employment Verification",  "issuer": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "verificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "schema": {    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",    "type": "object",    "properties": {      "credentialSubject": {        "type": "object",        "properties": {          "givenName": {            "type": "string"          },          "employedAt": {            "type": "string"          }        },        "required": [          "givenName",          "employedAt"        ]      }    }  }}'The following response should be returned:{  "id": "525358c8-1949-495e-becf-aa19d4da6a69",  "type": "CredentialSchema2023",  "credentialSchema": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6ejZNa2plU..."}note  Important: Make sure to copy your Schema ID for the next step.Create Verifiable Credential‚ÄãNow we have all three objects needed to create a VC:Acme's DID (issuer)Verification Method IDAlice's DID (subject)Schema IDTo create the VC, run:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/credentials -d '{  "issuer": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "verificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "subject": "did:key:z6MkqcFHFXqzsYyDYrEUA2pVCfQGJz2rYoCZy5WWszzSW3o6",  "schemaId": "525358c8-1949-495e-becf-aa19d4da6a69",  "expiry": "2051-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",  "data": {    "givenName": "Alice",    "employedAt": "2022-08-20T13:20:10.000+0000"  }    }'The following response should be returned:{  "id": "4f294b40-addc-4c39-840c-c17432680538",  "fullyQualifiedVerificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "credential": {    "@context": [      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"    ],    "id": "http://localhost:8080/v1/credentials/4f294b40-addc-4c39-840c-c17432680538",    "type": [      "VerifiableCredential"    ],    "issuer": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",    "issuanceDate": "2023-08-02T20:42:19Z",    "expirationDate": "2051-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",    "credentialSubject": {      "employedAt": "2022-08-20T13:20:10.000+0000",      "givenName": "Alice",      "id": "did:key:z6MkqcFHFXqzsYyDYrEUA2pVCfQGJz2rYoCZy5WWszzSW3o6"    },    "credentialSchema": {      "id": "525358c8-1949-495e-becf-aa19d4da6a69",      "type": "CredentialSchema2023"    }  },  "credentialJwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6..."}The VC is signed and packaged as a JWT in the credentialJwt property. If you're interested, you can decode the JWT using a tool such as jwt.io. If you were to issue or transmit the credential to a holder you would just send this JWT value.Getting Credentials‚ÄãOnce you've created multiple credentials, you can view all credentials by making a GET request to /v1/credentials. This endpoint also supports three query parameters: issuer, schema, and subject which can be used mutually exclusively.You can get a single credential by making a GET request to /v1/credentials/{id}.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousCreate a SchemaNextCredential Issuance ServiceNarrativeSteps to Create a VCSSI Service SetupCreate Verifiable CredentialGetting Credentials2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

It's based on JSON Schema and specifies which properties the issuer will use to create the VC. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to construct a schema and use the SSI Service to create it.Background on SchemasWhen creating Verifiable Credentials, it's useful to have a mechanism to define the shape the data in the credential takes, in a consistent manner.The VC Data Model uses an open world data model, and with it, provides a mechanism to extend the core terminology to add any term with a technology known as JSON-LD. JSON-LD is responsible for the @context property visible in VCs, DIDs, and other documents in the SSI space. However, JSON-LD is focused on semantics, answering the question "do we have a shared understanding of what this thing is?". More specifically, for a name credential, does your concept of "name" match mine? Though the core data model is a JSON-LD data model, processing VCs as JSON-LD is not a requirement. The SSI Service chooses to take a simpler approach and processes VCs as pure JSON.When constructing and processing VCs as pure JSON, it's useful to have a mechanism to define the data and add some light validation onto the shape that data takes. JSON Schema is a widely used, and widely supported toolset that enables such functionality: the ability to define a schema, which provides a set of properties (both required and optional), and some light validation on top of those properties. The VC Data Model has a section on data schemas that enables this functionality.1. Construct the JSON Schema‚ÄãLet's create a plain JSON Schema for an email address.Keywords‚ÄãThe JSON Schema Core Vocabulary is made up of keywords, which all begin with $, and are used to process schemas and guarantee interoperability.The two keywords needed for our JSON schema are $id and $schema.$id‚ÄãThe $id keyword identifies a schema resource with its canonical URI.  Note that this URI is an identifier and not necessarily a network locator. In the case of a network-addressable URL, a schema does not need to be downloadable from its canonical URI.{  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/email.json",}$schema‚ÄãFor the $schema keyword, we'll use the JSON Schema Draft 2020-12{  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/email.json",  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",}Next, we'll define the data needed for our schema: an email address. This includes the name, type, and properties of the data:{  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/email.json",  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",  "name": "Email Address",  "type": "object",  "properties": {    "emailAddress": {      "type": "string",      "format": "email"    }  },}We see that the schema defines a property emailAddress of type string and format email.The next part of the JSON specifies any required properties. We want an email address to be a required property of the schema so we indicate that as such:{  "$id": "https://example.com/schemas/email.json",  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",  "name": "Email Address",  "type": "object",  "properties": {    "emailAddress": {      "type": "string",      "format": "email"    }  },  "required": ["emailAddress"]}This means that any piece of JSON we apply this schema to will pass if a valid emailAddress property is present and will fail otherwise. 2. Create Credential Schema‚ÄãNow that we have a valid JSON Schema, we'll need to transform it so that it's not just any arbitrary JSON, but can be applied to a Verifiable Credential.infoPrerequisite‚ÄãFollow guide to Clone & Run SSI ServiceSigned vs. Unsigned Schemas‚ÄãThe SSI Service exposes a set of APIs for managing schemas. To create a schema you have two options: signed or unsigned. The signed version of a schema is packaged as a VC. In some cases, it's useful to package a JSON Schema as a VC to retain information about authorship (who created the schema), when it was created, and enable other features the VC Data Model offers, such as the ability to suspend the usage of a schema.Let's look at the approach for creating both kinds of schemas.Create Unsigned Schema‚ÄãTo apply our JSON Schema to a Verifiable Credential, let's add emailAddress in the credentialSubject property then execute a PUT request to /v1/schemas:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/schemas -d '{  "name": "Email Credential",  "schema": {    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",    "type": "object",    "properties": {      "credentialSubject": {        "type": "object",        "properties": {          "emailAddress": {            "type": "string",            "format": "email"          }        },        "required": ["emailAddress"]      }    }  }}'Upon success, you'll see a response which includes the schema you passed in, a service-generated identifier for the schema, and a JsonSchema2023 type:{  // Schema identifier  "id": "ebeebf7b-d452-4832-b8d3-0042ec80e108",  // Schema type  "type": "JsonSchema2023",  // Schema that was passed into request  "schema": {    "$id": "http://localhost:3000/v1/schemas/ebeebf7b-d452-4832-b8d3-0042ec80e108",    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",    "name": "Email Credential",    "properties": {      "credentialSubject": {        "properties": {          "emailAddress": {            "format": "email",            "type": "string"          }        },        "required": [          "emailAddress"        ],        "type": "object"      }    },    "type": "object"  }}Create Signed Schema‚ÄãSigned schemas are packaged as VCs themselves, and therefore require a few additional properties. At minimum, we'd need: issuer - The DID of the VC issuerverificationMethodId - The ID of the verification methodcurl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/schemas -d '{  "name": "Email Credential",  "issuer": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "verificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw#z6MkjePG6UBCLbrgUQgURoTSuXAbRpDbCdTLEPUXDqUC4EFw",  "schema": {    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",    "type": "object",    "properties": {      "credentialSubject": {        "type": "object",        "properties": {          "emailAddress": {            "type": "string",            "format": "email"          }        },        "required": ["emailAddress"]      }    }  }}'Signed VC schemas are created the same way unsigned ones are - by executing a PUT request to v1/schemas.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousCreate a DIDNextCreate Credentials1.

If that service trusts the issuer, then they can trust the claim, and it is easy and instant to check. This is sometimes called the triangle of trust. Verify the Credential‚ÄãChecking a credential can be done using DIF's JavaScript libraries. To get these libraries, run the following command within an npm project:npm install did-jwt-vc did-resolver key-did-resolverThen an app can verify the credentialsJwt anywhere with the following:VerifyCredentials.jsimport { verifyCredential } from 'did-jwt-vc'import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'const vcJwt = // use credentialJwt from aboveconst vc = await verifyCredential(vcJwt, new Resolver(getResolver()))console.log("Credentials are:", vc.verifiableCredential.credentialSubject)console.log("Issued by: ", vc.issuer)You will then see output like: Credentials are: {  firstName: 'Satoshi',  lastName: 'Nakamoto',  id: 'did:web:skounis.github.io'}Issued by:  did:key:z6MkqGF11YyzCgVr6G3dVJULjbBokSXN4J3cjSB5MQdXto4oNote that this shows that the credential is in tact and valid. However, it is up to the verifier to determine if they trust the issuer DID. That is the link between the verifier and issuer in the triangle of trust. You can establish this trust ahead of time - to know in the future you can trust any credentials they issue.There is a lot more in that vc object, such as URLs to check for revocation and more, but this is the heart of it. Below, we'll demonstrate the VC lifecycle with an example.‚ÄãExample: A Credit Score Service‚ÄãWe have a fictitious credit scoring bureau called MoeX. MoeX will issue a credential that contains a user's credit score and they can share this VC freely with anyone. This will be a web app which takes a user's DID and name, and then returns a VC which contains their credit score. Design a Schema‚ÄãMoeX has 2 items in its credit credential: Credit Score (required) and Number of Defaults (optional). So, let's create a schema for this:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/schemas -d '{  "name": "Credit Score Credential",  "schema": {    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",    "type": "object",    "properties": {      "credentialSubject": {        "type": "object",        "properties": {          "creditScore": {            "type": "integer"         },          "numOfDefaults": {            "type": "integer"         }        },        "required": ["creditScore"]      }    }  }}'tipYou can probably make a better schema that doesn't disclose the customer's exact credit score but just a band if you like.Implement Issuance Service‚ÄãWe will implement this as a simple web app that sits in front of our ssi-service that we set up above. The ssi-service is a utility you can use to manage your DIDs and VCs that you are issuing, but you don't have to expose it to the internet. To implement an issuance service create a new Node.js project and install the dependencies:  npm install express axios Then add the following to a index.mjs file: index.mjsimport express from 'express';import axios from 'axios';const app = express();const port = 3000;app.use(express.json());// Function to check DIDconst checkDid = (did) => {  // implement logic to ensure we trust the person asking for the VC  return true;}// Function to get credit scoreconst getCreditScore = () => {  // This generates a random integer score. But replace this with real logic, of course  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 101);}app.get('/issue', async (req, res) => {  try {    const { userDid, name } = req.query;    const isDidValid = checkDid(userDid);    const score = getCreditScore();    if (isDidValid) {      const response = await axios.put('http://localhost:8080/v1/credentials', {        issuer: "did:key:z6MkqGF11YyzCgVr6G3dVJULjbBokSXN4J3cjSB5MQdXto4o",        verificationMethodId: "did:key:z6MkqGF11YyzCgVr6G3dVJULjbBokSXN4J3cjSB5MQdXto4o#z6MkqGF11YyzCgVr6G3dVJULjbBokSXN4J3cjSB5MQdXto4o",        subject: userDid,        schemaId: "da43f310-dd2f-4e26-b571-840a93ec4071",        expiry: "2023-09-09T14:48:00.000Z",        data: {          creditScore: score        }      },      );      res.json(response.data);    } else {      res.status(400).send('Invalid DID');    }  } catch (err) {    console.error(err);    res.status(500).send('There was an error processing your request');  }});app.listen(port, () => {  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);});infoWithin the curl request, change the issuer value to the DID of the issuance server, and the verificationMethodId to the value from the issuer's DID document. If you don't have it handy, you can use the /v1/credentials endpoint to fetch it.Also, update the schemaId to the id returned in the response of the new schema we created in the previous step.Now run this:node index.mjsOpen a browser to localhost:3000.Get Credential from Issuance Service‚ÄãAccessing the url localhost:3000/issue?name=mic&did=did:web:mic.com will return a credential. Take note of the credentialJwt field for testing.That's it! Mic has his credential ready to use. Present the Credential‚ÄãNow Mic has his credit score in his hot little hand (wallet) and wants to use it. The easiest way is for him to present that as proof of his credit worthiness to a financial institution as the credentialJwt string along with any other data needed.infoA wallet holding the VC would make the presentation of it more user-friendly so that Mic isn't managing this large string.Verify the Credential‚ÄãThe financial institution could then verify Mic's credit.  In an NPM project, install these JavaScript libraries (there are libraries in all languages to do this):npm install did-jwt-vc did-resolver key-did-resolverCreate a program to check the credential:check_cred.mjsimport { verifyCredential } from 'did-jwt-vc'import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'import { getResolver } from 'key-did-resolver'// Mic's credit score credentialconst vcJwt = "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6ejZNa3VaYTFHVG14aVBTWnJ2ZEtaWjJjUHg4ZDFFWnJ2MlZiNVdwZ3RXUmRhdzRDI3o2TWt1WmExR1RteGlQU1pydmRLWloyY1B4OGQxRVpydjJWYjVXcGd0V1JkYXc0QyIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.t41Vlrw0e0tMZ8U7DtNO7_Jf95eg8bcI_sst8pkJHejUB4CceijCV03ZNGFSGDRXb_VqtLXVchAMiykEax2qCw"// Verify the credentialconst vc = await verifyCredential(vcJwt, new Resolver(getResolver()))if (!vc.verified) {  console.log("VC is not verified")  }console.log("Financial institution to check it trusts this issuer: " + vc.issuer)if (vc.verifiableCredential.credentialSubject.creditScore < 50) {    console.log("Credit denied: Too sketchy");} else {    console.log("Credit Approved")}console.log("Credentials are:", vc.verifiableCredential.credentialSubject)To check the results, run:node check_cred.mjsThe result should resemble:Financial institution to check it trusts this issuer: did:key:z6MkqGF11YyzCgVr6G3dVJULjbBokSXN4J3cjSB5MQdXto4oCredit ApprovedCredentials are: { creditScore: 76, id: 'did:web:mic.com' }Issued by:  did:key:z6MkqGF11YyzCgVr6G3dVJULjbBokSXN4J3cjSB5MQdXto4oThis shows that the credential is in tact and issued by an issuer that the financial institution trusts. It also will expire automatically on the expiration date that was provided when creating the credential.

Take, for instance, the process of acquiring a digital driver's license. To obtain this license, you'd need to know which pieces of information the license issuer (e.g., vehicle and driver's licensing agency or, in the U.S., the DMV) requires from you. The Credential Manifest, encapsulated as a JSON object, informs a User Agent (e.g., digital wallet) of the specific data it must submit to the Issuer on your behalf.In our digital driver's license example, the Credential Manifest might instruct your wallet: "The user must provide their name, photo, and driving test results."However, the Credential Manifest does not specify the content of the eventual digital driver's license, the method the DMV uses to verify your information, or the communication process between your wallet and the DMV. Its primary role is to guide your wallet on the necessary data that it needs to submit on your behalf.By the way, the items of the checklist in our example are called Input Descriptors. They describe the information that is required.noteCredential Manifest is a draft specification being developed within the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). The design work on the data model is ongoing and participants are encouraged to open issues or otherwise contribute to the project, whether as input to stable versions or as recommendations for future versions.Manifest API Requests‚ÄãCredential Manifests are JSON objects and most fields map to the definitions within the DIF Credential Manifest spec.Within the SSI Service Manifest API you can create, list, read, or delete Credential Manifests.Create a Credential Manifest‚ÄãIssuers create and host Credential Manifests for the credentials they offer. Assuming the DMV wants to create a Credential Manifest for their digital driver's license credential, they can use the SSI Service to do so.Field DefinitionsRequired‚Äãformat (object) - Formats that the Issuer can support when issuing the credential. At least one needs to be set. We currently only support jwt_vc for issuance. issuerDid (string) - DID that identifies who the Issuer of the credential(s) will be.outputDescriptors - Array of objects used to describe the Claims an Issuer is offering to a Holder.verificationMethodId (string) - The id of the verificationMethod whose privateKey is stored in SSI Service. The verificationMethod must be part of the DID document associated with Issuer. The private key associated with the verificationMethod's publicKey will be used to sign the issued credentials.Optional‚Äãdescription	(string) - Explains what the Manifest is generally offering in exchange for meeting its requirements.issuerName (string) - Human-readable name the Issuer wishes to be recognized by.name (string) - Human-readable name for the Manifest.presentationDefinition (object)	- Outlines the required data needed from the Subject.Here is the payload to submit to the v1/manifests endpoint. Notice the input_descriptors section outlines the checklist of required information that the wallet must provide on behalf of the user who is requesting this credential.{  "format": {    "jwt_vc": {      "alg": ["EdDSA"]    }  },  "issuerDid": "did:key:z6MkkZDjunoN4gyPMx5TSy7Mfzw22D2RZQZUcx46bii53Ex3",  "outputDescriptors": [    {      "id": "ca_driver_license_output",      "schema": "https://schema.org/EducationalOccupationalCredential"    }  ],  "presentationDefinition": {    "id": "ca_driver_license_input",    "input_descriptors": [      {        "id": "required_data",        "constraints": {          "fields": [            {              "path": [                "$.credentialSubject.fullName",                "$.credentialSubject.photo",                "$.credentialSubject.drivingTestResults"              ]            }          ]        }      }    ]  },  "verificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkkZDjunoN4gyPMx5TSy7Mfzw22D2RZQZUcx46bii53Ex3#z6MkkZDjunoN4gyPMx5TSy7Mfzw22D2RZQZUcx46bii53Ex3"}Save the JSON above to a file (e.g., cm_dl.json) and make a PUT request to create the Credential Manifest:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/manifests -d @cm_dl.jsonnoteWe saved the payload as a file because its special characters can be mistaken as variable indicators by the shell interpreterUpon success, the Credential Manifest will be returned in the form of a JSON object:{  "credential_manifest": {    "id": "31dbc01e-f2f9-476d-8b8c-20168f053c1d",    "spec_version": "https://identity.foundation/credential-manifest/spec/v1.0.0/",    "issuer": {      "id": "did:key:z6MkkZDjunoN4gyPMx5TSy7Mfzw22D2RZQZUcx46bii53Ex3"    },    "output_descriptors": [      {        "id": "ca_driver_license_output",        "schema": "https://schema.org/EducationalOccupationalCredential"      }    ],    "format": {      "jwt_vc": {        "alg": [          "EdDSA"        ]      }    },    "presentation_definition": {      "id": "ca_driver_license_input",      "input_descriptors": [        {          "id": "required_data",          "constraints": {            "fields": [              {                "path": [                  "$.credentialSubject.fullName",                  "$.credentialSubject.photo",                  "$.credentialSubject.drivingTestResults"                ]              }            ]          }        }      ]    }  }}List Credential Manifests‚ÄãTo obtain a list of all Credential Manifests, make a GET request to v1/manifests:curl -X GET localhost:8080/v1/manifestsTo obtain a list all Manifests associated with a specific Issuer, pass in the Issuer's DID as the id:curl -X GET localhost:8080/v1/manifests -d '{  "issuer": {    "id": "did:key:z6MkkZDjunoN4gyPMx5TSy7Mfzw22D2RZQZUcx46bii53Ex3"  }}'Get a Credential Manifest‚ÄãTo get a specific Manifest, submit a GET request to /v1/manifests/{id} and pass in the id of the Manifest:curl -X GET localhost:8080/v1/manifests/31dbc01e-f2f9-476d-8b8c-20168f053c1dDelete a Credential Manifest‚ÄãTo delete an existing manifest, make a DELETE request to v1/manifests/{id} passing in the id of the Manifest you wish to delete:curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/v1/manifests/31dbc01e-f2f9-476d-8b8c-20168f053c1dWas this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousVerifiable PresentationsNextPresentation RequestsWhat is a Credential Manifest?Manifest API RequestsCreate a Credential ManifestList Credential ManifestsGet a Credential ManifestDelete a Credential Manifest2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

One of the mechanisms by which they retain this control is through the usage of credential status.Credential status can be implemented through any valid JSON-LD type, to specify any status such as whether a credential is suspended or revoked. The most prominently used type is the Status List.To make use of credential status, issuers must follow the rules outlined in the Status List specification to build a status list credential, and then include the requisite values in the credentialStatus property of any VC they issue according to the Status List Entry portion of the specification.How does Status List work?Status List provides:‚ÄãIssuers a mechanism to express the status of a given credential.Verifiers a mechanism to check the status of a given credential.Holders a set of privacy guarantees about status checks for credentials they hold.The way this works with SSI Service:‚ÄãIssuers create a new credential using bitstring that represents credential statuses that are unique for each <issuer, credential schema> pair.Then, for each new credential an issuer creates for a given schema:A new credential status credential is created or an existing credential status credential is used.The credentials contain a reference to the status list credential contained in the credential's credentialStatus property, which can be used by verifiers to check the status of the credential.Bitstring and Herd Privacy:‚ÄãStatus credentials use a bitstring which can provide herd privacy for credential holders. In simpler terms this means that many credentials can be represented in a single bitstring, so it is not clear which credential/holder a verifier is requesting information about which is great for holder privacy."Credential Status" Credential‚ÄãHere is an example of a status list credential. Note that in addition to being of type VerifiableCredential, it is also of type StatusList2021Credential. Also note the credentialSubject.type property is set to Status2021:{  "@context": [    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",    "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"  ],  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3",  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "StatusList2021Credential"],  "issuer": "did:example:12345",  "issued": "2021-04-05T14:27:40Z",  "credentialSubject": {    "id": "https://example.com/status/3#list",    "type": "StatusList2021",    "statusPurpose": "revocation",    "encodedList": "H4sIAAAAAAAAA-3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQwfoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIC3AYbSVKsAQAAA"  },  "proof": { ... }}Credential with a Credential Status‚ÄãIn this example, the credential references a status list credential in the given credentialStatus section. Also, notice that the credential also has a statusListIndex of 94567, which is an arbitrary integer that identifies the position of the status of the verifiable credential:{  "@context": [    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",    "https://w3id.org/vc/status-list/2021/v1"  ],  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/23894672394",  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],  "issuer": "did:example:12345",  "issued": "2021-04-05T14:27:42Z",  "credentialStatus": {    "id": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3#94567",    "type": "StatusList2021Entry",    "statusPurpose": "revocation",    "statusListIndex": "94567",    "statusListCredential": "https://example.com/credentials/status/3"  },  "credentialSubject": {    "id": "did:example:6789",    "type": "Person"  },  "proof": { ... }}The verification process would be as follows:‚ÄãHolder did:example:6789 presents their credential to a verifier.Verifier makes a request to resolve the credential status credential identified by https://example.com/credentials/status/3.Upon resolution of this credential, the verifier checks the value of the bitstring at index 94567.If present, the credential has a revoked status.

Think of it like a checklist, formally known as a Presentation Definition, which outlines what the Verifier needs to know. It specifies the "claims" or credentials that the Holder needs to provide, offering them various options to meet these criteria. In some scenarios, this request may also be digitally signed for added security and might include special features to prevent replay attacks.To illustrate, imagine Alice wants to rent a car from Acme Car Rentals. Alice, acting as the Holder, has a driver's license in a digital wallet. Acme, being the Verifier, sends a Presentation Request to Alice's wallet to check if she has a valid driver's license. This is essentially Acme's way of asking Alice's wallet to show her driver's license VC for verification.Presentation API Requests‚ÄãAlice walks into Acme Car Rentals, ready to rent a car for the weekend.
Acme needs to verify that Alice has a valid driver's license before renting her a car.Let's explore how the Presentation Requests resource can be used in this scenario.infoPrerequisites‚ÄãFollow guide to Run SSI ServiceCreate a Presentation DefinitionCreate a DID (or use an existing one). Save the id (DID) and verificationMethodIdCreate a Presentation Request‚ÄãField DefinitionsRequired‚ÄãissuerId (string) - DID of the issuer of the Presentation Definition. The DID must have been previously created with the DID API.verificationMethodId (string) - ID of the verificationMethod whose private key is stored in the SSI Service. This is defined within the DID Document.presentationDefinitionId (string) - ID of the presentation definition to use for this request.Optional‚Äãaudience	(array of strings) - The audience claim specifies who the Presentation Request is intended for. If used, each recipient processing the Presentation Request (like Acme in our example) should find their DIDs listed in this field, or else reject the request. This helps ensure that the Presentation Request is being used by the right parties.callbackUrl	(string) - The URL where the presentation submission should be sent. If provided, this is the endpoint to which the presenter (like Alice's wallet in our example) will send the necessary credentials for verification. expiration	(string) - The deadline for using this Presentation Request. After this time, the request becomes invalid and can't be processed.Alice uses her digital wallet app to scan the QR code displayed at the Acme counter. The QR code contains initial data that lets Alice's wallet know that a Presentation Request will be coming from Acme.At this point, Acme's system receives a notification indicating that Alice's wallet has scanned the QR code and is awaiting a Presentation Request.Acme initiates a PUT request to v1/presentations/requests to ask for Alice's credentials:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/presentations/requests -d '{ "issuerId": "did:key:z6MkirxnoyzmKW36bGwZCZoHSofBZTfSStpUdrQdesfnithM", "presentationDefinitionId": "24ae411e-e3ca-4217-b055-5fb306b2bb5c", "verificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkirxnoyzmKW36bGwZCZoHSofBZTfSStpUdrQdesfnithM#z6MkirxnoyzmKW36bGwZCZoHSofBZTfSStpUdrQdesfnithM"}'The Presentation Request is generated and sent back to Alice's wallet:{  "presentationRequest": {    "id": "5411efba-20d9-446a-8882-b024ba75c5df",    "issuerId": "did:key:z6MkirxnoyzmKW36bGwZCZoHSofBZTfSStpUdrQdesfnithM",    "verificationMethodId": "did:key:z6MkirxnoyzmKW36bGwZCZoHSofBZTfSStpUdrQdesfnithM#z6MkirxnoyzmKW36bGwZCZoHSofBZTfSStpUdrQdesfnithM",    "presentationDefinitionId": "24ae411e-e3ca-4217-b055-5fb306b2bb5c",    "presentationRequestJwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImt..."  }}Alice's wallet processes the request and prompts Alice to approve or deny the request for information. After Alice approves the request, the wallet generates a Presentation containing the requested credentials and sends it back to Acme for verification.Acme verifies Alice's credentials and proceeds with renting Alice a car.List Presentation Requests‚ÄãThe manager of Acme Car Rentals occasionally performs audits of their rental processes to measure several aspects such as transaction time, credential acceptance rates, etc. The manager initiates a GET request to v1/presentations/requests in order to obtain a list of all the Presentation Requests that they processed:curl -X GET localhost:8080/v1/presentations/requestsGet a Presentation Request‚ÄãDuring the audit, the Acme manager notices an irregularity and needs more details on the Presentation Request that was made to Alice earlier in the day. To dive deeper into the specifics of that particular request, the manager initiates a GET request to v1/presentations/requests/{id}, specifying the ID of the Presentation Request:curl -X GET localhost:8080/v1/presentations/requests/24ae411e-e3ca-4217-b055-5fb306b2bb5cThis retrieves detailed information on the Presentation Request identified by that ID, allowing the manager to carefully review and ascertain whether all protocols were adequately followed.Delete a Presentation Request‚ÄãWithin Acme, another customer scans the QR code and generates a Presentation Request, however he decides he'd rather not rent a car today and tells Acme to cancel the request. Acme issues a DELETE request to v1/presentations/requests/{id} to remove the Presentation Request:curl -X DELETE localhost:8080/v1/presentations/requests/16bf410e-e5ba-4318-b144-5fb306b2aa6aWas this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousCredential ManifestsNextLink a DID to a DomainPresentation API RequestsCreate a Presentation RequestList Presentation RequestsGet a Presentation RequestDelete a Presentation Request2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Click DIDs tab‚Äã2. Click Add New‚Äã3. Set DID Method‚ÄãThere are three different DID methods to choose from: Ion, Web, and Key. The DID Key method is a good method for testing purposes so let's select that for now.4. Set keyType and options‚ÄãClick Try sample input and then submit.Learn more about what you can add to this field.Create a Verifiable Credential (VC)‚Äã1. Click Credentials tab‚Äã2. Click Create New‚Äã3. Add name and description‚ÄãFeel free to use the default placeholders or describe your new VC. Then click Next.4. Prep VC Schema‚ÄãSet Schema to New data set.Click Try sample input and fill in the VC subject's first and last name.Click Next.See properties you can add to this schema.5. Set Input Descriptors (optional)‚ÄãClick Try sample input and leave the default JSON for now, and click Next.This field populates the presentation_definition field of the credential_manifest. When a subject, for example an employee, applies for this credential, they will be required to present any credentials defined in this field. Here, we are asking for a credential with the subject's firstName and a credential with the subject's lastName. The path field defines which path we can expect to find these values in the subject's provided credentials.6. Set issuer information‚ÄãFill in an issuer name (company name) for the employment verification, then click Submit.A new VC has now been created.Next Steps for VCs‚ÄãSend an Application‚ÄãShare the Application URL with subjects, employees in this case, to apply for their new employment verifiable credential.The credential applicant will need to submit a credential application as a JSON Web Token (JWT). Once they submit the JWT, the application will become available for review in the dashboard, under Credentials > Applications.Learn more about applications.Issue a VC‚ÄãClick Issue on a created VC.Subject DID: Add your employee's DID.Subject Data: Fill in your employee's first and last name.Decide whether you want this DID to be revocable or suspendableSet an expiration date if you want it to expire.Issuer DID: Choose one of the employers' DIDs.Verify a Credential‚ÄãWe use presentation definitions to create submission links, through which subjects can submit their relevant credentials for verification.1. Click Verification tab‚Äã2. Click Create New‚Äã3. Name your presentation definition‚Äã4. Set Purpose‚ÄãInclude the purpose of your presentation definition. It should answer: why are you requesting this credential?5. Set Input Constraints‚ÄãClick Try sample input again and leave the default added JSON for now.
It will look for credentials to verify the firstName and lastName.6. Set verifier‚ÄãChoose your verifier DID from the dropdown. You can use the same Ion DID you used to create the VC.infoVerification Applications vs Submissions:Applications: When an employee applies for a credential with your application link, and you as the employeer will see that application here for the you (the employer) to approve or decline. If you approve their application you would then issue their employment credential.Submissions: When an employer asks a job applicant to submit an education VC for example before accepting their role.Next Steps‚ÄãSee SSI Service API DocsLearn how to create a VCWas this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousRun SSI ServiceNextCreate a DIDCore FunctionalityInstallationClone and Run SSI ConsoleCreate a Decentralized Identifier (DID)1.

Sharing consists of creating a package of credential(s) and transmitting the package to another party.What is a Verifiable Presentation?‚ÄãPackaging a credential or set of credentials into a presentation is called Verifiable Presentations.Verifiable Presentations are a standard data container that serve as an authenticated wrapper around a set of credentials to be verified. Verifiable Presentations provide a number of benefits such as:a common data format designed to work with Verifiable Credentials and is reusable in any number of use casesguidance on constructing presentations that ensures integrity protection and guards against replay attacksPresentations impose no constraints on who can construct them or what may be presented. This means if you have multiple credentials issued to different DIDs, you can still construct a Verifiable Presentation to present those credentials at the same time. To make this possible, the proof property of a VC can be an array of proofs. {  "@context": [    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1"  ],  "id": "urn:uuid:3978344f-8596-4c3a-a978-8fcaba3903c5",  "type": ["VerifiablePresentation", "CredentialManagerPresentation"],  "verifiableCredential": [{  }],  "proof": [{  }]}Verifiers must ensure that the credentials in a given presentation can be presented by the presenter, and that the credentials themselves are valid.SSI Service Support for Verifiable Presentations‚ÄãVerifiable Presentations are currently accepted in two main SSI Service flows: verifying Presentation Submissions while using Presentation Exchangeverifying Credential Applications while using Credential ManifestAs a utility, we've also exposed an endpoint to statelessly verify a presentation by making a PUT request to /v1/presentations/verification. infoPrerequisite‚ÄãFollow guide to Run SSI ServiceA sample request is as follows:curl -X PUT localhost:8080/v1/presentations/verification -d '{    "presentationJwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsImtpZCI6ImRpZDprZXk6ejZNa21OMTI5NnVhcEhtTTZBMjhuR1pHZEFFbmlEMWFhNVJkRkNuOEpFdW5xVjlrI3o2TWttTjEyOTZ1YXBIbU02QTI4bkdaR2RBRW5pRDFhYTVSZEZDbjhKRXVucVY5ayIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2OTExNzU2MjQsImlzcyI6ImRpZDprZXk6ejZNa21OMTI5NnVhcEhtTTZBMjhuR1pHZEFFbmlEMWFhNVJkRkNuOEpFdW5xVjlrIiwianRpIjoiYjQ0OTI0ZWEtMDIwMi00ZTllLWJiMmEtOTg5YmQwNWQ1N2FlIiwibmJmIjoxNjkxMTc1NjI0LCJub25jZSI6IjVjNmFhZDc2LWUyZWYtNGNiNy1iMWE4LTI3MjZiMjRhM2Y0ZSIsInZwIjp7IkBjb250ZXh0IjpbImh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDE4L2NyZWRlbnRpYWxzL3YxIl0sInR5cGUiOlsiVmVyaWZpYWJsZVByZXNlbnRhdGlvbiJdLCJ2ZXJpZmlhYmxlQ3JlZGVudGlhbCI6WyJleUpoYkdjaU9pSkZaRVJUUVNJc0ltdHBaQ0k2SW1ScFpEcHJaWGs2ZWpaTmEyMU9NVEk1Tm5WaGNFaHRUVFpCTWpodVIxcEhaRUZGYm1sRU1XRmhOVkprUmtOdU9FcEZkVzV4VmpsckkzbzJUV3R0VGpFeU9UWjFZWEJJYlUwMlFUSTRia2RhUjJSQlJXNXBSREZoWVRWU1pFWkRiamhLUlhWdWNWWTVheUlzSW5SNWNDSTZJa3BYVkNKOS5leUpwWVhRaU9qRTJPVEV4TnpVMk1qUXNJbWx6Y3lJNkltUnBaRHByWlhrNmVqWk5hMjFPTVRJNU5uVmhjRWh0VFRaQk1qaHVSMXBIWkVGRmJtbEVNV0ZoTlZKa1JrTnVPRXBGZFc1eFZqbHJJaXdpYW5ScElqb2lPRFUyTnpRellURXRZamxsWWkwME56Z3lMV0kzTkRjdE5UbGtOekkzWVRGaVlXWTFJaXdpYm1KbUlqb3hOamt4TVRjMU5qSTBMQ0p1YjI1alpTSTZJamsyTkRkalltTmtMV0k0WkRndE5HVXhNeTFpTURKa0xURXpZelUxTm1RNVlqRTFPQ0lzSW5OMVlpSTZJbVJwWkRwclpYazZlalpOYTIxT01USTVOblZoY0VodFRUWkJNamh1UjFwSFpFRkZibWxFTVdGaE5WSmtSa051T0VwRmRXNXhWamxySWl3aWRtTWlPbnNpUUdOdmJuUmxlSFFpT2xzaWFIUjBjSE02THk5M2QzY3Vkek11YjNKbkx6SXdNVGd2WTNKbFpHVnVkR2xoYkhNdmRqRWlYU3dpZEhsd1pTSTZXeUpXWlhKcFptbGhZbXhsUTNKbFpHVnVkR2xoYkNKZExDSmpjbVZrWlc1MGFXRnNVM1ZpYW1WamRDSTZleUpsYlhCc2IzbGxjaUk2SWxSQ1JDSXNJbXB2WWxScGRHeGxJam9pVkhWMGIzSnBZV3dnUVhWMGFHOXlJbjE5ZlEuWEJPbjBTd2RZZUMwN2dHM1VkT1ZLeHV2YXpfWVRpRkNmZ2tpZXJhZUZnVkEtT2tkWDM1SWl6T0NhdUtqdWlsQXJzZklvMkNYN1pYaDl3djRhUXZFRGciXX19.pJXQXSJcu4U752IE0IH21Yw26OsGMLrHE_-LpGLDHkfetQoJk56j9Fflg-P68xVgfNwZ4EBgGEJ88bXLRv1aDQ"}'Upon success, the following response should be returned:{   "verified": true}Other Projects for Verifiable Presentations‚ÄãThere's more that you can do with Verifiable Presentations outside of the SSI Service.Constructing a Verifiable Presentation‚ÄãConstructing a Verifiable Presentation is out of scope for the SSI Service since the service acts as a utility for organizations managing their own credentials.

One way to do this is by proving that the entity that controls a DID is also in control of a specific web origin (a website's location). A method to achieve this connection involves utilizing a resource known as a Well Known DID Configuration.Imagine Alice controls a reputable website, https://example.com. She can use DID Configuration to prove that she is the same entity controlling her DID and her website. This proof involves cryptographic signatures that show Alice is connected to both, allowing others to verify that Alice's DID and her website are indeed managed by the same entity.This configuration can be created via the SSI Service.Create a DID Configuration‚ÄãinfoPrerequisites‚ÄãCreate a DID (or use an existing one): Save the DID id and verificationMethodIdAn origin you control (e.g., https://example.com)The ability to host files in a path within that origin. (i.e., you are able to host the file returned via https://example.com/.well-known/did-configuration.json)To make the claim that her DID is associated with her origin, Alice uses the SSI Service to issue herself a Domain Linkage Credential.

Instead, it allows willing counterparties to negotiate and establish the minimum information acceptable for an exchange.Why do we need tbDEX?‚ÄãThe web connected us all, but money and payments have not kept pace. The legacy payment system is held together with proverbial duct tape, concealing fundamental problems. Final settlement of payments is slow, expensive, and never quite final. These inefficiencies result in costly account fees or outright exclusion from the system, disproportionately affecting the economically disadvantaged.Decentralized and trustless systems eliminate the need for credit checks, monthly account fees, and barriers to international money movement. Yet, legacy fiat systems are projected to stay integral to our financial systems for the foreseeable future. This is why our global financial system and the customers it serves needs a smooth method to transition between fiat and digital currencies.That's where tbDEX comes in. It acts as a bridge between the permissionless world of digital currencies and the traditional world of fiat money. As a liquidity protocol, it enables these two distinct financial systems to communicate. Additionally, tbDEX facilitates fiat-to-fiat exchanges since it's designed to operate fluently with both digital and fiat currencies.tbDEX isn‚Äôt just another exchange or centralized financial institution; it‚Äôs a protocol that any member of our financial systems can join to allow for portability and interoperability across currencies, nationalities, and, most importantly, people.Furthermore, tbDEX cultivates a network that encourages competition among financial institutions for customers' business, offering them a choice among multiple providers. This competitive landscape incentivizes PFIs to offer more reasonable transaction fees, as they vie to attract and retain users within the tbDEX ecosystem. The integration of financial institutions and wallet applications into one protocol ensures that every wallet has access to every participating financial institution, fostering a customer-centric environment where quality of service and cost-efficiency become key differentiators. This is transformative for liquidity companies, where the challenge to integrate with all wallets, especially smaller ones, is too high. With tbDEX, liquidity providers and aggregators can adopt the protocol once and enable thousands of wallets.How does tbDEX work?‚ÄãtbDEX bridges digital and fiat currencies by providing a common protocol for the fundamental actions of liquidity exchange.Note that tbDEX is not a payment processor, wallet/bank account, or any other core financial service provider. Instead, tbDEX focuses on enabling commerce rather than executing transactions.Actors‚ÄãThere are essentially three types of actors involved in a tbDEX network:Wallet Apps: These hold identifiers and credentials, acting as an agent to facilitate exchanges on behalf of a person seeking liquidityPFIs: The entities offering liquidity services on the tbDEX networkVC Issuers: Organizations that act as sources of verifiable credentialsMessages‚ÄãUsing the tbDEX protocol, PFIs and wallet holders - both identified by unique DIDs - can exchange messages to negotiate an exchange.As part of negotiating an exchange, PFIs and wallets message each other using the following tbDEX message types:Request for Quote (RFQ): a request for the PFI to provide a quote specifically for the user based on the financial exchange they are requesting, the payment methods provided, etc. The RFQ also includes the proof of required credentials.Quote: a formal offer from a PFI detailing exactly what the user will receive in exchange for a specific currency or asset, as per their RFQ. It also includes the total fees associated with the chosen payment methods, instructions for making the payment and receiving the funds, and an expiration time after which the terms of the quote are no longer guaranteed.Order: an agreement to execute the transaction. At this time, both parties have agreed upon a settlement method for the transaction and can smoothly off-ramp from the tbDEX platform to the desired method of settlement.Order Status: updates on execution of the order, sent by the PFI. Close: signifies that the exchange has reached a terminal state. It can be used if the PFI is unable to provide a guaranteed quote to the RFQ, if Alice is no longer interested in the quote, if the order has failed, or if the order has completed. No messages can be added to an Exchange after a Close has been sent. Example Scenario‚ÄãAlice holds a digital wallet that securely manages her identity, including her identifiers, credentials, and authorizations for external apps and entities. Alice wants to exchange 100 units of digital currency for USD. Because Alice is off-ramping from digital currency to fiat, most PFIs are required to verify Alice‚Äôs identity in order to fulfill their regulatory and compliance obligations.Alice informs her wallet of her need to make the exchange.Alice's Wallet discovers PFIs that offer this currency pairing, compares their credential requirements with the VCs Alice holds, and if necessary, applies for any missing VCs.The Credential Issuer (if applicable) issues the required VCs to Alice, which are stored in her wallet.Alice‚Äôs Wallet presents the offerings to Alice, allowing her to choose the one she‚Äôd like to transact with.Alice considers the reputation of the PFIs as well as the transaction fees before choosing a PFI. Alice's Wallet creates a request for a quote (RFQ) with Alice's DID, the details of her request, and the required VC - which Alice has already obtained from another PFI in the past. The PFI receives the RFQ, verifies the credentials, and responds with a quote. Alice's Wallet accepts the quote by placing the order. The PFI sends order statuses to the Wallet to update Alice about the order.The PFI fulfills the order then sends a close message to Alice‚Äôs Wallet.Try tbDEX‚ÄãWithout the need for any centralized authority, tbDEX provided a groundbreaking bridge between the traditional financial system and the emerging world of digital currencies by allowing Alice to exchange her digital currency for USD. By leveraging decentralized technologies, tbDEX: Offers a permissionless and inclusive platform that allows for the direct transfer of funds across different currency systems and borders Enforces competition among PFIs, ensuring more equitable transaction fees and services for users Upholds necessary regulatory standards, requiring identity verification for transactions converting digital currency to fiat, aligning with compliance mandates. As a result, tbDEX stands as a pivotal innovation for seamless financial exchanges, offering a versatile solution for developers, institutions, and individuals alike.

We struggle to secure personal data with hundreds of accounts and passwords we can‚Äôt remember. On the web today, identity and personal data have become the property of third parties.Web5 brings decentralized identity and data storage to your applications. It lets devs focus on creating delightful user experiences, while returning ownership of data and identity to individuals.The Web5 SDK helps you create a decentralized app in minutes.QuickstartContributeUse CasesControl Your IdentityAlice holds a digital wallet that securely manages her identity, data, and authorizations for external apps and connections. Alice uses her wallet to sign in to a new decentralized social media app. Because Alice has connected to the app with her decentralized identity, she does not need to create a profile, and all the connections, relationships, and posts she creates through the app are stored with her, in her decentralized web node. Now Alice can switch apps whenever she wants, taking her social persona with her.Own Your DataBob is a music lover and hates having his personal data locked to a single vendor. It forces him to regurgitate his playlists and songs over and over again across different music apps. Thankfully there's a way out of this maze of vendor-locked silos: Bob can keep this data in his decentralized web node. This way Bob is able to grant any music app access to his settings and preferences, enabling him to take his personalized music experience wherever he chooses.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousGetting StartedNextAPI Reference2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Some of these apps even function as social media sites for book enthusiasts.Let's create a decentralized app for readers who want to keep reviews on the various books they've read. Rather than being locked into one book review app, they wish to have control over their reviews and easily share them across different platforms.This tutorial demonstrates how to use Web5.js to create an app that stores users' book reviews within their DWNs so that they can be accessed by any app on the web that has permission.Running Locally‚ÄãDownload a copy to your local machine and run the following commands to start the app.Note: If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running npm install -g pnpm.git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.gitcd developer.tbd.websitepnpm installpnpm start:tutorial-book-reviewsinfoOnline Playground‚ÄãYou can open the finished app directly in CodeSandbox
Setup‚ÄãInstall Web5npm install @web5/apiIn the root of your project, find and open package.json and add module as a type:{  "dependencies": {    "@web5/api": "0.8.2"  },  "type": "module"}Within a code editor, create a new JS file (e.g. book_reviews.js).Open this JS file and import Web5import { Web5 } from "@web5/api";Additional import for Node 18/*Needs globalThis.crypto polyfill.This is *not* the crypto you're thinking of.It's the original crypto...CRYPTOGRAPHY.*/import { webcrypto } from "node:crypto";// @ts-ignoreif (!globalThis.crypto) globalThis.crypto = webcrypto;Additional imports for React Native/*React Native needs crypto.getRandomValues polyfill and sha512.This is *not* the crypto you're thinking of.It's the original crypto...CRYPTOGRAPHY.*/import "react-native-get-random-values";import { hmac } from "@noble/hashes/hmac";import { sha256 } from "@noble/hashes/sha256";import { sha512 } from "@noble/hashes/sha512";ed.etc.sha512Sync = (...m) => sha512(ed.etc.concatBytes(...m));ed.etc.sha512Async = (...m) => Promise.resolve(ed.etc.sha512Sync(...m));secp.etc.hmacSha256Sync = (k, ...m) =>  hmac(sha256, k, secp.etc.concatBytes(...m));secp.etc.hmacSha256Async = (k, ...m) =>  Promise.resolve(secp.etc.hmacSha256Sync(k, ...m));Now we have the Web5 SDK installed and are ready to start building!Connect to Web5‚ÄãThe first thing we want to do is connect. In Web5 apps, this replaces the traditional login step. Instead of centralized accounts that belong to one application, users have DIDs and DWNs, decentralized identity and storage, respectively.const {web5, did: userDid} = await Web5.connect();Without parameters, this function will look for a local DWN and DID on the user's device and will connect to it. If it doesn't already exist, a DID and local DWN will be automatically created.The connect() function returns an instance of Web5 as web5 as well as the user's DID as did. The web5 instance gives you access to Web5's three core pillars: web5.did, web5.vc, and web5.dwn.noteNote that your app can allow users to connect with an agent and provide an existing DID and remote DWN.Create Interoperable Data‚ÄãNow that the user has connected, your app can obtain any public or permissioned data from their DWN, even if your app didn't create the data. This is the power of DWNs - users are able to keep their data with them and utilize it in any app that allows this.In order for data to be interoperable across apps, the apps must understand and support the same data structure. Fortunately, this is not a new concept. In fact, schema.org exists for this very reason - to provide a shared vocabulary for structured data.There's a schema for just about anything you can think of, including reviews!Provided this is the schema the app will support for reviews, let's indicate that within our code://Schema we'll use for Book Reviewsconst schema = {    "context": 'https://schema.org/',    "type": 'Review',    get uri() { return this.context + this.type; }}Get Book Reviews‚ÄãThe objects that are written to a DWN are called records. To query for records from a user's DWN, we call web5.dwn.records.query() and pass in filters to find the specific records we want. In our case, we want to query for all records that follow the Review schema.//Query book review (search for DWN records)async function getReviews() {    let {records} = await web5.dwn.records.query({        message: {            filter: {                schema: schema.uri            },        },        dateSort: 'createdAscending'    });    return records;}let existingReviews = await getReviews();process.exit();This returns an array of records that match our schema. Your app can display the user's existing reviews as you see fit.Add Book Review‚ÄãYour app may offer the ability for users to create new book reviews. If so, you'll write their reviews to their DWNs as opposed to your own backend server.Your interface may allow the user to enter a star rating (1-5) as well as a review for any given book. Your app would then take that data and structure objects that match the Review schema.This JSON represents multiple reviews the user wants to add and follows the Review schema.//Book Reviewslet reviews = [    {        "@context": schema.context,        "@type": schema.type,        "itemReviewed": {            "@type": "Book",            "name": "The Great Gatsby",            "author": {                "@type": "Person",                "name": "F.

Orwell's work is as relevant today as it was when it was first published."    },    {        "@context": schema.context,        "@type": schema.type,        "itemReviewed": {            "@type": "Book",            "name": "Brave New World",            "author": {                "@type": "Person",                "name": "Aldous Huxley"            },            "datePublished": "1932",            "genre": "Dystopian",            "identifier": "978-0060850524",        },        "author": {            "@type": "Person",            "identifier": userDid        },        "datePublished": "2023-09-18",        "reviewRating": {            "@type": "Rating",            "ratingValue": "4.8"        },        "reviewBody": "A deeply disturbing yet essential read. Huxley's vision of a future driven by technology and hedonism serves as a potent warning for society."    }]Notice that the reviews contain author.identifier that specifies the DID of the user who is authoring the review.Now that we have the data in an interoperable format, we want to write it to the user's DWN. But first, let's make a function to see if the review they are submitting already exists within their DWN.//checks if review already exists (you may not want duplicate data in the DWN)async function isReviewPresent(review) {    for(let record of existingReviews) {        let bookData = await record.data.json();        let isbn = bookData.itemReviewed.identifier;        if(isbn === review.itemReviewed.identifier) {            return true;        }    };    return false;}Within our addReviews() function, we'll loop through the reviews that the user wants to add, call isReviewPresent() to make sure it doesn't already exist, and if it doesn't, we'll call web5.dwn.records.create() to add the review to the user's DWN.//Create book review (write record to DWN)async function addReviews() {    for (const review of reviews) {        let reviewExists = await isReviewPresent(review);        if (reviewExists) {            console.log(`Review for ${review.itemReviewed.name} already exists`);        }        else {            const response = await web5.dwn.records.create({                data: review,                message: {                    schema: schema.uri,                    dataFormat: 'application/json',                    published: true,                },            });            if (response.status.code === 202) {                console.log(`Review for ${review.itemReviewed.name} added successfully`);            } else {                console.log(`${response.status}. Error adding review for ${review.itemReviewed.name}`);            }        }    }    existingReviews = await getReviews();}let existingReviews = await getReviews();await addReviews();process.exit();Let's look a bit closer at the call that creates the record:const response = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: review,    message: {        schema: schema.uri,        dataFormat: 'application/json',        published: true,    },});We see that create() accepts data and message. The data is the payload of the record and the message is metadata about that payload.Notice that we provide the actual book review as the value of data, and for the message, we're specifying the:URI of the schemaformat of the datapublicity of the data. Because we specified the records as published, they are available for public queries without requiring authorization.All of this metadata helps with the discoverability of the data by apps.Also note that while the user wants to create multiple reviews, there's no way to create multiple records at the same time with Web5. Instead, we called create() for each record that needed to be added, via a loop.Update Book Review‚ÄãYour app may have access to update book reviews as well. Let's write a function that calls the web5.dwn.record.update() method to change the rating of one of the reviews.//Update book review ratingasync function updateReviewRating(review, newRating) {    let bookData = await review.data.json();    console.log(`old rating for ${bookData.itemReviewed.name}`, bookData.reviewRating.ratingValue);    //Update the value within the JSON then send the entire JSON to update    bookData.reviewRating.ratingValue = newRating;    let response = await review.update({        data: bookData    });    if (response.status.code === 202) {        //Obtain the updated record        const { record: updatedReview } = await web5.dwn.records.read({            message: {                filter: {                    recordId: review.id                       }            },        });        const updatedData = await updatedReview.data.json();        console.log(`updated rating for ${bookData.itemReviewed.name}`, updatedData.reviewRating.ratingValue);    }    else console.log(`${response.status}. Error updating rating for ${bookData.itemReviewed.name}`);}let existingReviews = await getReviews();await addReviews();await updateReviewRating(existingReviews[1], "4.2");process.exit();Delete Book Reviews‚ÄãIf your app is permissioned to do so, you can also delete book reviews from the user's DWN.//Delete all book reviewsasync function deleteReviews() {    let records = await getReviews();    for (const record of records) {        let title = (await record.data.json()).itemReviewed.name;        let response = await web5.dwn.records.delete({            message: {                recordId: record.id,            }        });        console.log(`deleted ${title}. status: ${response.status.code}`);    }}let existingReviews = await getReviews();await addReviews();await updateReviewRating(existingReviews[1], "4.2");await deleteReviews();process.exit();Congrats! You've created an application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes book reviews from a user's DWN. The user is free to take their reviews with them and use it in any app that they grant permission.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousBuild a Shared Todo AppNextUpgrade Your App to Web5Running LocallySetupConnect to Web5Create Interoperable DataGet Book ReviewsAdd Book ReviewUpdate Book ReviewDelete Book Reviews2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

I am a wanderer in search of an application where I can send short-text messages to my best friend, Bob.üöÄ Your missionBuild Dinger, a self-sovereign, modern day pager that allows users to send short text-based messages or "dings" to each other.üõ†Ô∏è Your toolkitTo build this app, you will wield the following technologies:React - A JavaScript library, your brush to paint user interfaces, craft reusable components, and manage the state of your creation.Next.js - A React metaframework, your compass to guide you through creating pages, managing routes, and managing server-side rendering.Web5.js - A Web5 JavaScript SDK, your key to creating decentralized applications, facilitating direct communication between users, and granting them sovereignty over their data and identity.üèÜ Your rewardBy the end of this journey, you will acquire a deeper understanding of peer-to-peer communication in a Web5 ecosystem.If you're ready for the challenge, let's get started!noteThis tutorial is most suitable for those who prefer to learn by doing.Level 1: Explore the starter code‚ÄãGood news! You don't have to start from scratch. There is a pre-built application that contains the user interface for Dinger. Right now, the functions in the code don‚Äôt do much. They just print messages to the console and don‚Äôt have any real actions. As you progress through the tutorial, you will add logic to the functions.üìù Task‚ÄãTo access the starter code, follow the instructions below or explore the project directly in CodeSandbox.Note: If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running npm install -g pnpm.git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.gitcd developer.tbd.websitepnpm installpnpm start:tutorial-dinger-starterFinished Dinger AppIf you‚Äôd like to skip ahead and see the finished version of this tutorial, you can check out the running app on CodeSandbox.You can also download and run the example by executing:Note: If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running npm install -g pnpm.git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.gitcd developer.tbd.websitepnpm installpnpm start:tutorial-dinger-completedThere is also a hosted example deployed at https://dinger-chat.vercel.app/To fully interact with the web app, please click "Open in New Tab" as demonstrated in the GIF below.üïµÔ∏è What to Explore‚ÄãNavigate to the src/pages/index.js file.Identify the functions that currently only print console.logs.Try to understand how each function interacts.Level 2: Connect to Web5 and create a DID‚Äãüìù Task‚ÄãLocate the line:src/pages/index.jsconsole.log(`this log is in initWeb5`);and replace it with the following code snippet:src/pages/index.jsconst { web5, did } = await Web5.connect();setWeb5(web5);setMyDid(did);üß© Breaking it down‚ÄãWeb5.connect() returns a Web5 instance: It initializes and returns an instance of Web5, allowing you to interact with the Web5 ecosystem.Web5.connect() also creates or connects to a DID: A DID (Decentralized Identifier) is a user‚Äôs unique ID card for the decentralized, digital world. It belongs only to you. Web5.connect() will either connect to an existing DID that you have or create a new one for you if you don't have one yet. A DID acts as an authenticator for Web5 apps, removing the need for login credentials.üìò Learn more‚ÄãLearn more about DID authentication.Level 3: Define and install a protocol‚Äãüìù Task‚ÄãLocate the line:src/pages/index.jsconsole.log(`this log is in configureProtocol`);And replace it with the following code snippet:src/pages/index.jsconst dingerProtocolDefinition = {  protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",  published: true,  types: {    ding: {      schema: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/ding",      dataFormats: ["application/json"],    },  },  structure: {    ding: {      $actions: [        { who: "anyone", can: "write" },        { who: "author", of: "ding", can: "read" },        { who: "recipient", of: "ding", can: "read" },      ],    },  },};const { protocols, status: protocolStatus } =  await web5.dwn.protocols.query({    message: {      filter: {        protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",      },    },  });if (protocolStatus.code !== 200 || protocols.length === 0) {  const { protocolStatus } = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({    message: {      definition: dingerProtocolDefinition,    },  });  console.log("Configure protocol status", protocolStatus);};üß© Breaking it down‚ÄãdingerProtocolDefinition: This object defines the protocol, its structure, and it grants permissions outlining who can perform specific actions like reading or writing a ding.web5.dwn.protocols.query(): This function checks if the protocol already exists.web5.dwn.protocols.configure(): This function installs the protocol.üìò Learn more‚ÄãLearn more about protocols.Level 4: Write to the DWN‚Äãüìù Task‚ÄãLocate the line:src/pages/index.jsconsole.log(`this log is in writeToDwn`);And replace it with the following code snippet:src/pages/index.jsconst { record } = await web5.dwn.records.write({  data: ding,  message: {    protocol: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/dinger-chat-protocol",    protocolPath: "ding",    schema: "https://blackgirlbytes.dev/ding",    recipient: recipientDid,  },});return record;üß© Breaking it down‚ÄãYou are storing each ding on a Decentralized Web Node (DWN), or personal data store.

If you're eager to see immediate updates for testing purposes, you can adjust the sync settings. Update the line:src/pages/index.jsconst { web5, did } = await Web5.connect();to:src/pages/index.jsconst { web5, did } = await Web5.connect({sync: '5s'});This change forces a synchronization interval to happen every 5 seconds. However, be cautious: this is not recommended for production applications as it can lead to higher resource usage, battery drain, and potential rate limiting.üß† Knowledge check‚Äãü´° Mission complete‚ÄãCongratulations! By building Dinger, you've successfully empowered users like Alice to communicate peer-to-peer and maintain sovereignty over her data and identity. Now, Alice can send messages to her best friend, Bob.

We will expand on the core features and build out a more collaborative app that allows multiple users work on the same, shared todo list.This is also a multi-paged app, so we will learn how we can reuse a web5 instance across multiple pages.Objectives‚ÄãBob and Alice are two friends that love doing things together. They often have specific goals and a bunch of tasks each of them have to complete to achieve this goal.We will build a decentralized shared todo app that allows them to collaborate on their tasks while also being able to have these tasks on other apps they use if needed.We are going to learn how to:Enforce permissions or authorization on records through protocolsSend and update records across multiple users' Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)By the end of this tutorial, we'll have gained an understanding of protocols, DWN to DWN communication, and how to build a multi-user app on the decentralized web.Our Toolkit‚ÄãWe will use the following tools to build our app:Web5 SDK - a JavaScript SDK for building decentralized web appsNuxtJS - a VueJS framework for building web applicationsTailwindCSS - a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designsGet the Skeleton App‚ÄãTo follow this tutorial, you can use your own UI design or use our starter code.

We have the following key files in our app:pages/index.vue - the home page of the apppages/todos/[id].vue - the page for viewing a todo listassets/shared-todo-protocol.json: a JSON file defining the protocol used for sharing to-do listsOur shared todo app will have the following features that we need to build out:Creating a todo list with another userDisplaying all todo lists with different usersAdding tasks to a todo listMarking tasks as completedInitialize Constants and Variables‚ÄãWe are building a multi-paged application and as a result, we will need to access Web5 on multiple pages. However we want to avoid running Web5.connect() on every page as it would impact performance. Instead, we will create a Nuxt plugin and have our Web5 instance and DID available across our application.Create a new file at plugins/web5.client.js and add the following code:plugins/web5.client.js    import { Web5 } from '@web5/api';    export default defineNuxtPlugin({        async setup (nuxtApp) {            console.log("Plugin loaded")            let web5;            let myDID;            ({ web5, did: myDID } = await Web5.connect({                sync: '5s'            }));            console.log("Here's your DID", myDID)            return {                provide: {                    web5,                    myDID                }            };        },    });The first time a user accesses your Shared Todo app, you‚Äôll need to handle creating an account for them - this means ensuring they have a DID and DWN available to access their app data. Once they come back for subsequent sessions, you‚Äôll want to fetch and load that data for them.In the code above, we import and connect to Web5 while setting sync interval to 5 seconds. This is the amount of time between automatic syncs of the user's local and remote DWNs. We also return the web5 and myDID variables to be available across our application.Open pages/index.vue and add the following code after all the import statements under <script setup>:pages/index.vue// Get our global web5 instance and DID.const { $web5: web5, $myDID: myDID } = useNuxtApp();// The lists of existing todo itemsconst sharedList = ref([]);The web5 object is the single entry point for all Web5 operations. You've also set up a sharedList array to hold our shared lists, and a variable to remember the app user's decentralized identifier (DID) as myDid.Set Permissions and Authorizations‚ÄãProtocols help define both the data schema and permissions as it relates to a certain application or use case. It details what objects are stored as part of the application and who has what permissions on these objects.For our app, let's define the objects that we want to use in our app: list and todo; and also define who has what permissions:Anyone can read and write a listThe author and recipient of a list can write to the todo listCreate a new file called shared-todo-protocol.json under the assets/ folder and add the following protocol defintion:assets/shared-todo-protocol.json{  "protocol": "https://didcomm.org/shared-todo",  "published": true,  "types": {    "list": {      "schema": "https://didcomm.org/shared-todo/schemas/list.json",      "dataFormats": ["application/json"]    },    "todo": {      "schema": "https://didcomm.org/shared-todo/schemas/todo.json",      "dataFormats": ["application/json"]    }  },  "structure": {    "list": {      "$actions": [        {          "who": "anyone",          "can": "read"        },        {          "who": "anyone",          "can": "write"        }      ],      "todo": {        "$actions": [          {            "who": "author",            "of": "list",            "can": "write"          },          {            "who": "recipient",            "of": "list",            "can": "write"          }        ]      }    }  }}Install the Protocol‚ÄãTo implement this protocol, we have to install it in our app for any of the users.Let's import the protocol definition:pages/index.vueimport protocolDefinition from "~/assets/shared-todo-protocol.json";Now, we can create the function that checks if the protocol is installed and installs it if it isn't.pages/index.vueconst configureProtocol = async () => {    // query the list of existing protocols on the DWN    const { protocols, status } = await web5.dwn.protocols.query({        message: {            filter: {                protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,            }        }    });    if(status.code !== 200) {        alert('Error querying protocols');        console.error('Error querying protocols', status);        return;    }    // if the protocol already exists, we return    if(protocols.length > 0) {        console.log('Protocol already exists');        return;    }    // configure protocol on local DWN    const { status: configureStatus, protocol } = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({        message: {            definition: protocolDefinition,        }    });    console.log('Protocol configured', configureStatus, protocol);}Once this is done, we create an onBeforeMount function and call the configureProtocol function as the page loads.pages/index.vueonBeforeMount(async () => {    await configureProtocol()});Create Shared List‚ÄãRight now, we have no existing lists, so we need to create one.We currently have the following variables already declared - newTodo and sharedList. We will use these to store the form data for a new list and all other existing lists respectively.pages/index.vueconst newTodo = ref({    title: '',    description: '',    recipientDID: '',});const sharedList = ref([]);Now we proceed to update the createSharedList function.pages/index.vueconst createSharedList = async () => {    let recipientDID = newTodo.value.recipientDID;    const sharedListData = {        "@type": "list",        "title": newTodo.value.title,        "description": newTodo.value.description,        "author": myDID,        "recipient": newTodo.value.recipientDID,    }    newTodo.value = { title: '', description: '', recipientDID: '' }    try {        const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({            data: sharedListData,            message: {                protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,                protocolPath: 'list',                schema: protocolDefinition.types.list.schema,                dataFormat: protocolDefinition.types.list.dataFormats[0],                recipient: recipientDID            }        });        const data = await record.data.json();        const list = {record, data, id: record.id};        sharedList.value.push(list);        showForm.value = false        const { status: sendStatus } = await record.send(recipientDID);        if (sendStatus.code !== 202) {            console.log("Unable to send to target did:" + sendStatus);            return;        }        else {            console.log("Shared list sent to recipient");        }    } catch (e) {        console.error(e);        return;    }}To break this down, we are creating a new list with the following properties:@type: the type of object we are creating (in our case, it is a list)title: the title of the listdescription: the description of the listauthor: the DID of the author of the listrecipient: the DID of the recipient of the listThen we use the web5.dwn.records.create function to create the list, providing it with both the data and the protocol definition. The protocol definition ensures our data adheres to the correct permissions and structure.Now we have to ensure that the recipient also receives this new list data. And for that, we use record.send().pages/index.vueconst { status: sendStatus } = await record.send(recipientDID);But how do users get to easily copy and share their own DIDs with other users? We are going to implement a Copy DID feature.pages/index.vueconst copyDID = async() => {    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(myDID);    alert('DID copied to clipboard');}And in the <template> section, we update the header to include the copy DID button.pages/index.vue<header class="flex-col text-center mb-4">    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Shared Todo</h1>    <p>Manage a set of todos towards your goals with friends.</p>    <button v-if="myDID" class="btn" id="copy-did" @click="copyDID">Copy your DID</button></header>We are now able to create new lists, which updates our UI immediately. The next step is to fetch existing lists from the DWN for both the authors and recipient.infoTesting the App‚ÄãTo simulate multiple users with different DIDs in order to test the app, you can have a tab open in different browsers, or have one tab in normal browser mode and another tab in incognito mode.Display Todo Lists‚ÄãUsing our onBeforeMount() method, we've been able to initialize web5, and configure our protocol. We also use this method to fetch existing lists from the DWN.pages/index.vueonBeforeMount(async () => {    ...    // Fetch shared todo lists    const{ records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({        message: {            filter: {                schema: protocolDefinition.types.list.schema,            },            dateSort: 'createdAscending'        }    });    console.log("Saved records", records);    // add entry to sharedList    for (let record of records) {        const data = await record.data.json();        const list = {record, data, id: record.id};        sharedList.value.push(list);    }...});We are querying the DWN for all records that match the schema of our protocol. We then add each record to our sharedList array.üéâ We have completed the first feature of our app. We can now create todo lists and share them with another user.Add Tasks‚ÄãThe next part of our project involves adding specific todos to each list. We want both participants of the list to be able to add todos, but only the author of each task can mark it as done. This behaviour is enforced by the protocol that we added earlier.Using NuxtLink, we are able to navigate to our list page by passing the listId as a url parameter (e.g localhost:3000/todos/[id]). This is why we have pages/todos/[id].vue in our project to dynamically render based on the list we open.Fetch List Details‚ÄãIn our dynamic todo page, let's import the protocol definition document so it can be reused.pages/todos/[id].vueimport protocolDefinition from "~/assets/shared-todo-protocol.json";We need to fetch the list details from the DWN so let's get the list id from the url parameter, get our global web5 and myDID variables and use the listId to query the DWN for the list.pages/todos/[id].vueconst route = useRoute();const listId = ref(route.params.id);const { $web5: web5, $myDID: myDID } = useNuxtApp();onBeforeMount(async () => {    console.log("this is your DID", myDID);    // fetch shared list details    const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({        message: {            filter: {                recordId: listId.value            }        }    })    todoList = await record.data.json();    fetchingListInfo.value = false;});We update the todoList variable with the data from the DWN which is shown on our page.Fetch Tasks from List‚ÄãEvery list comes with its own tasks. We can fetch this also in the onBeforeMount() method.pages/todos/[id].vueonBeforeMount(async () => {    console.log("this is your DID", myDID);    // fetch shared list details    const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({        message: {            filter: {                recordId: listId.value            }        }    })    // fetch todos under list    const { records: todoRecords } = await web5.dwn.records.query({        message: {            filter: {                parentId: listId.value            },        }    })    todoList = await record.data.json();    // add entry to array    for (let record of todoRecords) {        const data = await record.data.json();        const todo = { record, data, id: record.id };        todoItems.value.push(todo);    }    fetchingListInfo.value = false;});Add Tasks to List‚ÄãTo add a task, we want to connect it to the list as the parent, identify who authored it, store it with the schema matching the protocol and then also send it to the other party's DWN.To get the DID of the recipient to send the record to, since either of the author or recipient of the list could be the one creating the todo, we use a getTodoRecipient() method to help us out.pages/todos/[id].vuelet todoRecipient;const getTodoRecipient = () => {    if (myDID === todoList.author) {        return todoList.recipient;    } else {        return todoList.author;    }}Then in the onBeforeMount() method, let's update the todoRecipient variable so that it's only updated when we've fetched the list details and gotten the participating DIDs.pages/todos/[id].vueonBeforeMount(async () => {...    todoList = await record.data.json();    todoRecipient = await getTodoRecipient();...});Create Task‚ÄãWe create a new todo by calling the web5.dwn.records.create() method. We pass the data we want to store, and the protocol definition.pages/todos/[id].vueasync function addTodo() {    const todoData = {        completed: false,        description: newTodoDescription.value,        author: myDID,        parentId: listId.value    };    newTodoDescription.value = '';    const { record: todoRecord, status: createStatus } = await web5.dwn.records.create({        data: todoData,        message: {            protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,            protocolPath: 'list/todo',            schema: protocolDefinition.types.todo.schema,            dataFormat: protocolDefinition.types.todo.dataFormats[0],            parentId: listId.value,            contextId: listId.value,        }    });    const data = await todoRecord.data.json();    const todo = { todoRecord, data, id: todoRecord.id };    todoItems.value.push(todo);    const { status: sendStatus } = await todoRecord.send(todoRecipient);    if (sendStatus.code !== 202) {        console.log("Unable to send to target did:" + sendStatus);        return;    }    else {        console.log("Sent todo to recipient");    }}Toggle Todo Status‚ÄãWe can toggle the status of a todo as completed by updating the completed property of the todo and sending it to the other party:pages/todos/[id].vueasync function toggleTodoComplete(todoItem) {    let toggledTodo;    let updatedTodoData;    for (let todo of todoItems.value) {        if (todoItem.id === todo.id) {            toggledTodo = todo;            todo.data.completed = !todo.data.completed;            updatedTodoData = { ...toRaw(todo.data) };            break;        }    }    // Get record in DWN    const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({        message: {            filter: {                recordId: toggledTodo.id                            }        }    });    // Update the record in DWN    await record.update({ data: updatedTodoData });    const { status: sendStatus } = await record.send(todoRecipient);    if (sendStatus.code !== 202) {        console.log("Unable to send updated data to target did:", sendStatus);        return;    }    else {        console.log("Sent todo update to recipient");    }}Congratulations!

It‚Äôs composed of a Vue.js app powered by web5.js which adds data storage underpinned by a Decentralized Web Node (DWN).The ToDo app is a basic single-user, local application that only leverages web5.js for storage purposes, but serves as an important precursor to building larger decentralized apps.By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll have a solid understanding of the basics of creating, reading, and writing to a DWN and will be on your way to creating serverless, decentralized applications.Getting the Skeleton App‚ÄãDownload a copy of the skeleton ToDo app by running:Note: If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running npm install -g pnpm.git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.gitcd developer.tbd.websitepnpm installpnpm start:tutorial-todo-starterIn this tutorial, you‚Äôll work through completing the src/App.vue file under /examples/tutorials/todo-starter to use web5.js.Finished ToDo AppIf you‚Äôd like to skip ahead and see the finished version of this tutorial, you can check out the running app on CodeSandbox.You can also download and run the example by executing:Note: If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running npm install -g pnpm.git clone https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website.gitcd developer.tbd.websitepnpm installpnpm start:tutorial-todo-completedThere is also a hosted example deployed at https://unrivaled-crumble-56ce70.netlify.app/.Setup‚ÄãAdd Web5 to package.json in the dependencies section:{  "dependencies": {    "@web5/api": "0.8.2"  },  "type": "module"}Download the necessary packages by running these commands:pnpm installpnpm run devYou should now have the app running on https://localhost:5173; this will be a starter application with a mostly blank page. In this tutorial, we'll build the rest.App Architecture‚ÄãThere are 3 main components to your ToDo app: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The way that web5.js changes the layout of your ToDo app compared to the way a traditional web app would be laid out is by replacing the RESTful calls you‚Äôd normally make with calls to the DWN.noteThink of web5.js as your storage, RESTful API service, and the backing data store.Because we‚Äôve built this sample app using Vue.js, you‚Äôll find both the HTML structure of the app and the JS logic within the App.vue file. Your ToDo app will have a few main responsibilities to implement:Create a new DWN for the user or load their saved DWN for storageDisplay ToDosCreate ToDosDelete ToDosToggle ToDo statusInitialize Constants and Variables‚ÄãOpen src/App.vue in your editor and add this next to the other imports:import { Web5 } from "@web5/api";First we'll set up instances to hold data you'll use throughout your application.Copy the following block and paste under all import statements in src/App.vue:let web5;let myDid;const todos = ref([]);The web5 object is the single entry point for all Web5 operations. You've also set up a todos array to hold your ToDos, and a variable to remember the app user's decentralized identifier (DID) as myDid.Create DID and Web5 Instance‚ÄãThe first time a user accesses your ToDo app, you‚Äôll need to handle creating an ‚Äúaccount‚Äù for them - this means ensuring they have a DID and DWN available to access their app data. Once they come back for subsequent sessions, you‚Äôll want to fetch and load that data for them.Add to src/App.vue:onBeforeMount(async () => {  ({ web5, did: myDid } = await Web5.connect());});Displaying Todos‚ÄãYou can now make calls to the DWN to fetch, write, and delete data. To load your user‚Äôs existing ToDos, call:onBeforeMount(async () => {  ...  // Populate ToDos from DWN  const { records } = await web5.dwn.records.query({    message: {      filter: {        schema: 'http://some-schema-registry.org/todo'      },      dateSort: 'createdAscending'    }  });});Once you‚Äôve loaded the query data, you can map this data from the DWN into an object for your app to use:onBeforeMount(async () => {  ...  // Add entry to ToDos array  for (let record of records) {    const data = await record.data.json();    const todo = { record, data, id: record.id };    todos.value.push(todo);  }});Now that your app user's ToDos are stored in their DWN, you can display them by using the todos object. In this example, you can do it by adding the following HTML code to the Vue app below the JS, just as you would in any non-Web5 app.In the template where you see <!-- ToDos --> add this:<div v-if="(todos.length > 0)" class="border-gray-200 border-t border-x mt-16 rounded-lg shadow-md sm:max-w-xl sm:mx-auto sm:w-full">  <div v-for="todo in todos" :key="todo" class="border-b border-gray-200 flex items-center p-4">    <div @click="toggleTodoComplete(todo)" class="cursor-pointer">      <CheckCircleIcon class="h-8 text-gray-200 w-8" :class="{ 'text-green-500': todo.data.completed }" />    </div>    <div class="font-light ml-3 text-gray-500 text-xl">      {{ todo.data.description }}    </div>    <!-- Delete ToDo goes here later -->  </div></div>infoNote that this UI code fulfills more than just loading the ToDos - it also provides the ability to toggle completion status and delete ToDos, which we‚Äôll get to in a bit.Adding ToDos‚ÄãTo allow for add functionality, begin by creating the UI needed to add ToDos.In the template add this code block to <!-- Add ToDos Form -->:<div class="mt-16">  <form class="flex space-x-4" @submit.prevent="addTodo">    <div class="border-b border-gray-200 sm:w-full">      <label for="add-todo" class="sr-only">Add a todo</label>      <textarea        rows="1" name="add-todo" id="add-todo" v-model="newTodoDescription"        @keydown.enter.exact.prevent="addTodo"        class="block border-0 border-transparent focus:ring-0 p-0 pb-2 resize-none sm:text-sm w-96"        placeholder="Add a Todo" />    </div>    <button type="submit" class="bg-indigo-600 border border-transparent focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:ring-offset-2 hover:bg-indigo-700 inline-flex items-center p-1 rounded-full shadow-sm text-white">      <PlusIconMini class="h-5 w-5" aria-hidden="true" />    </button>  </form></div>Next, you can add a Todo to storage by binding a addTodo() method to the UI and leveraging the newTodoDescription model referenced in the textarea to call the web5 method dwn.records.create:// Adding ToDosconst newTodoDescription = ref('');async function addTodo() {  const todoData = {    completed   : false,    description : newTodoDescription.value  };  newTodoDescription.value = '';  // Create the record in DWN  const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data    : todoData,    message : {      schema     : 'http://some-schema-registry.org/todo',      dataFormat : 'application/json'    }  });}This code uses the myDid object we loaded or created in the onBeforeMount function and uses it to write into the DWN that web5 is using to store your app user's data.Once we‚Äôve written the data to storage, we‚Äôll use the returned record to create your app's todo object, passing along the record.id :async function addTodo() {...  // add DWeb message recordId as a way to reference the message for further operations  // e.g. updating it or overwriting it  const data = await record.data.json();  const todo = { record, data, id: record.id };  todos.value.push(todo);}Deleting ToDos‚ÄãDeleting ToDos can be done by using the deleteTodo method, passing the todoItem:// Delete ToDoasync function deleteTodo(todoItem) {  let deletedTodo;  let index = 0;  for (let todo of todos.value) {    if (todoItem.id === todo.id) {      deletedTodo = todo;      break;    }    index ++;  }  todos.value.splice(index, 1);  // Delete the record in DWN  await web5.dwn.records.delete({    message: {      recordId: deletedTodo.id    }  });}We‚Äôll connect that to the UI with the following code. This replaces the <!-- Delete ToDo goes here later --> comment we added earlier:<div class="ml-auto">  <div @click="deleteTodo(todo)" class="cursor-pointer">    <TrashIcon class="h-8 text-gray-200 w-8" :class="'text-red-500'" />  </div></div>Toggling ToDo Status‚ÄãTo toggle a ToDo‚Äôs status, you‚Äôll need to change its status both in your local todos object and in your web5-managed DWN. You can do so by modifying the todos object and then using a record.update call to update the ToDo in your data store:// Toggling ToDo Statusasync function toggleTodoComplete(todoItem) {  let toggledTodo;  let updatedTodoData;  for (let todo of todos.value) {    if (todoItem.id === todo.id) {      toggledTodo = todo;      todo.data.completed = !todo.data.completed;      updatedTodoData = { ...toRaw(todo.data) };      break;    }  }  // Get record in DWN  const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.read({    message: {      filter: {        recordId: toggledTodo.id      }    }  });  // Update the record in DWN  await record.update({ data: updatedTodoData });}Congratulations, you've just built a decentralized web app!

Whether you‚Äôre using React, Vue, or another front-end framework, it‚Äôs easy to convert your app to run on the decentralized web.Rather than focusing on a specific example application, this guide will serve as a template for how you can audit your own app and allow it to join the decentralized web. By the end, you‚Äôll understand the difference between your traditional web app and a decentralized web app, have gone through a checklist to evaluate how to migrate your app, and be prepared to migrate your app.Decentralized vs. Centralized Apps‚ÄãToday, your app probably works something like this:A user installs your app or navigates to your app‚Äôs url.The user signs in with a username and password, or an account likely tied to a major identity provider such as Google or Apple.Using that provided identity as a key, your app then creates a set of entries in your databases, likely hosted by a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.As your user begins using your app, the app‚Äôs frontend will repeatedly make calls to a backend that you‚Äôve stood up on your cloud provider to query databases and provide data to the user.Reading this over, you‚Äôll realize just how much of a dependency both your app and your user take on 3rd party providers. While this has been a stable model for developers for well over a decade, user identity, user data, app data, and app infrastructure are all hosted by 3rd parties. Web5 changes this by restoring control back to end users via  the following flow:A user installs or navigates to your app‚Äôs url.The user signs in to your app with an account tied to their Decentralized Identifier (DID).Using that provided identity as a key, your app then creates a set of entries in the user‚Äôs Decentralized Web Node (DWN), a personal data store which they host and own. DWN management can be simplified for end users through the use of a wallet, making decentralized apps accessible to average end users.As your user begins using your app, the app‚Äôs frontend will repeatedly make calls to the user‚Äôs DWN to query and provide data to the user. If there is app data needed, the app will query the app‚Äôs infrastructure DWNs to retrieve that information.You‚Äôll notice that while data ownership and location radically changed between these two models, nothing changed for the end user! That means that as a developer, all you need to do to provide the benefits of a web5 application to both yourself and your end users is to simply change where your data is stored.Redesigning Your Data for Web5‚ÄãRight now, your app is probably storing data in a variety of databases. Let‚Äôs say, for example, you‚Äôve created a basic todo app - you‚Äôll need to store your user‚Äôs account information including settings, plus you‚Äôll need to store their todos (you can build your own Todo app here). Rather than creating two databases to support this app, you can simply upgrade your app to run on web5 and leverage your user‚Äôs DWN to store and manage data. There are a number of ways you can achieve this migration:Start writing to the DWN. You can write to the user‚Äôs DWN as a data store by calling the records.create() method which will allow you to directly write data to their data store so long as you‚Äôve been granted permission to do so.Establish a protocol and programmatically install that protocol on the user‚Äôs DWN. By leveraging protocols, you can then remotely access your user‚Äôs DWN according to the contract defined by the installed protocol.Once you‚Äôve established where your data will reside and how it will be organized, then you‚Äôre ready to access it in your app.Accessing Your Data‚ÄãIn a traditional web app, you‚Äôll access your app data by repeatedly making calls to an API endpoint where your server will query your databases. Your app is probably full of code that looks something like this:Whether you‚Äôre developing with Vanilla JavaScript, React, or another framework, you‚Äôre going to make lots of REST calls to power your app. Since Web5 fundamentally restructures the way your data is stored, that means that all of your REST calls will need to change too. Now instead of fetching data via a POST call, you‚Äôll fetch data like this:'import { Web5 } from '@web5/api'const { web5, did: aliceDid } = await Web5.connect();  // Create the record  const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: 'Hello Web5',    message: {      dataFormat: 'text/plain',    },  });  // Read the record  const readResult = await record.data.text();The code snippet above has two critical components you need to understand:Creating or connecting with a DWNUnlike in a traditional web app, where storage is remote, your Decentralized Web App (DWA) can store data on a locally reproduced DWN. Although DWNs are publicly addressable, you‚Äôll simply need to connect to your DWN once using the connect method, then you can repeatedly query its data.Reading from the DWNDWNs are one monolithic data store, so you don‚Äôt need to call specific endpoints on them. Instead, once you‚Äôve connected to a DWN with your instance of web5, you can make calls into the data store using the query method and specify the type of data you‚Äôre looking to retrieve based on a semantic type. Getting your data is very straightforward this way, and doesn‚Äôt require you to remember the correct API endpoint to call or develop lots of API endpoints.Migrating Your App‚ÄãTo enable your app to run on the decentralized web, you‚Äôll need to take the following steps:Identify your current data storage and schema.Rewrite your data storage and schema to work with DWNs.Rewrite your REST calls as CRUD operations calls using web5.js to query the DWN.While the data migration may be relatively simple and straightforward for smaller apps, migrating your data could prove more difficult for larger apps with many databases. However once you‚Äôve made that transition, accessing your data store and modifying the code is not a problem!Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousBuild a Book Review AppNextVueDecentralized vs. Centralized AppsRedesigning Your Data for Web5Accessing Your DataMigrating Your App2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

Private records are not accessible without the use of a protocol or permissions. To make a record publicly available, the record must be published.In this guide, we‚Äôll discuss how to publish a record.Publish a record upon creation‚ÄãTo publish a record, you must explicitly declare that record as published by setting the published attribute to true when creating it:const {record} = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: "a published record",    message: {      dataFormat: "text/plain",      published: true    }  });Publishing records in the future‚ÄãWhen specifying to publish a record without providing the datePublished attribute, the record will be published now (the same date it was created). However, it's also possible to publish a record in the future by providing a future date for the datePublished attribute:// Create a new Date instance for tomorrowconst today = new Date();const tomorrow = new Date(today);tomorrow.setDate(today.getDate() + 1);// Format the date and time in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ssssssZ formatconst formattedDate = tomorrow.toISOString().replace(/\.\d{3}Z$/, '.000000Z');// Create a record today to be published tomorrowconst { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({  data: "This record will be created now and published tomorrow",  message: {    dataFormat: "text/plain",    published: true,    datePublished: formattedDate  },});infoThe datePublished value must be in ISO 8601 standard format for representing dates and times. It must be expressed in the 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.ssssssZ' format, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, DD is the 2-digit day, T is a separator, hh is the 2-digit hour in 24-hour format, mm is the 2-digit minute, ss.ssssss is the 2-digit second with microsecond precision of 6, and Z indicates the time is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousWrite DWN RecordsNextQuery DWN RecordsPublish a record upon creationPublishing records in the future2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

You do not need to call the send() function to write a record to a local DWN.const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: "this record will be written to the local DWN",    message: {        dataFormat: 'text/plain'    }});The same is true for the protocols.configure() function. It creates the protocol object and installs it on the user's local DWN. You do not need to call the send() method to install a protocol on a local DWN.const response = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({    message: {        definition: protocolDefinition    }});Send to User's Remote DWNs‚ÄãBy default, Web5 will automatically sync records and protocols between a user's local and remote DWNs. There is no special action required to accomplish this. However, sync happens on a predefined interval. If you want a record or protocol immediately sent to the user's remote DWNs, then you can call send(). This will only send that particular record or protocol to the remote DWNs and is not a full sync of the DWNs.const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: "this record will be written to the local DWN",    message: {        dataFormat: 'text/plain'    }});//immediately send record to user's remote DWNsconst {status} = await record.send(userDid);const { protocol } = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({    message: {        definition: protocolDefinition    }});//immediately send protocol to user's remote DWNsconst {status} = await protocol.send(userDid);Send to Recipient's DWNs‚ÄãAssuming permission has been established, one party can send records to another. To do so, the user can create the record and then call send() to send it to another party.const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: "this record will be created but not saved to DWN",    store: false, //remove this line if you want to keep a copy of the record in the sender's DWN    message: {        dataFormat: 'text/plain'    },});//send record to recipient's DWNconst {status} = await record.send(recipientDid);Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousDelete DWN RecordsNextHost a DWN ServerWrite to Local DWNSend to User's Remote DWNsSend to Recipient's DWNs2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

An agent is software that acts on behalf of a user to manage identity, public or private data, and interactions with other apps in a decentralized network. You can think of an agent as a box that contains a user's DIDs, private keys, and a DWN (which can also hold VCs). Agents are capable of managing multiple DIDs and are permissioned to use the private keys of DIDs to act on a user's behalf. Why is it called an agent?‚ÄãWe considered calling it a wallet, but that term is really overloaded. The idea of storing your personal data in a wallet didn't feel right. It would be a really thicc wallet. The kind of wallet that causes back problems.Agent is a term that describes something that can act on your behalf, which is one of the goals for our agents. Where does an agent live?‚ÄãA user's agent can live anywhere. It could be a headless process that runs on their computer; it could be their phone; it could be running on a machine at home. Agents don‚Äôt necessarily have root access over the user's device or even their data, but they do have all the authority necessary to provide agency.Web5 doesn't have remote agents today, so it simply creates an embedded agent if one doesn't already exist. When connecting to a Web5 app, if the user doesn't have an agent at all, the library will:create a fallback embedded agent directly in the browserbootstrap that agent with a DID and a set of necessary keys needed to sign and encrypt thingsWhy can't I connect directly to the DWN without an agent?‚ÄãInteracting with a DWN is complex and when combined with DIDs, VCs, signing, encryption, and sync, there is a LOT to do.A good analogy is that of a web browser as a "user agent" that's acting on behalf of a user when it interacts with web servers. Web browsers perform several key functions when interacting with web servers such as:requesting resources (dereferencing, redirects, caching, etc.)identifying itself with a user agent string to the web server to help the server deliver content that's optimized for the user's specific setup for
rendering web pagesmanaging cookies, session data, and other local storagehandling user interactionsproviding a user interface that's suitable for human / computer interaction If people had to do all of this manually, almost no one would use the web.Similarly, Web5 agents do a lot of things on behalf of the user when interacting with decentralized web apps and other people/entities on a decentralized network:secure storage of datasecure messaging and communicationinteroperability with other agents and networksuser-controlled sharing of dataidentity verification and authenticationidentity revocation and recoveryprivacy and anonymityAgents exist to handle these complexities on the user's behalf because it is too much for a human to do manually.What are future plans for agents?‚ÄãIn the near future, connecting to a Web5 app will invoke a UI that prompts a user to authenticate and grant an application access to said agent. Apps  can then request permissions to interface with a user's agent to store things in their DWNs.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousDID DocumentsNextProtocolsWhat is an agent?Why is it called an agent?Where does an agent live?Why can't I connect directly to the DWN without an agent?What are future plans for agents?2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

We're going to learn about how Alice and Bob do that using Web5 and the concepts that make up the Web5 ecosystem.What are DIDs?‚ÄãTL;DR‚ÄãAlice and Bob decide to get Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) so that others can easily find them on the decentralized web. This is just like how someone would find a website by typing a URL into a web browser, or a person by searching for their handle on a social media platform. Once they find Alice or Bob through their DIDs, they can do things like save them to their contact list, or message them through decentralized channels.Let's learn more‚ÄãA DID is an address representing who you are on the decentralized web. It can point to a person, organization, thing, data model, or abstract entity. It's through your DID that others can send messages and data, and be granted access to information you wish to share.A DID is a "type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity" (DID Core Spec). It is created and managed independently of any centralized authority or organization. The basic idea behind a DID is to give individuals and organizations control over their own identity information and to allow them to share that information selectively and securely with others as needed. This means that they can choose when and how to share their identity information, and with whom.DIDs are typically represented as a unique resource identifier (URI) and are designed to be used for identity verification, authentication, and authorization.Example of a Decentralized IdentifierThe key difference between a traditional centralized identifier, such as a username or email address, and a decentralized identifier is that the latter is not tied to a specific service provider or organization. An example of a centralized identifier you might have would be your Twitter handle or Google email address, where Twitter or Google are the centralized authority.Why we need it?‚ÄãWe need an identifier that isn't tied to a centralized authority, that we can take anywhere with us, and that can be used to identify us across any platform.Methods‚ÄãNow that Alice and Bob know that they need a DID let's take a look at the different kinds of DIDs they can have.There are lots of different implementations of DIDs (called DID methods) with different use cases. Web5 currently supports a few methods.did:key‚ÄãA did:key is free and fast to spin up. Since it can be created, but not updated or deleted, it is useful for single, ephemeral interactions.did:ion‚Äãdid:ion is an implementation of the sidetree protocol, which logs DID actions on any decentralized anchoring system, like a blockchain or other distributed ledger. In particular, did:ion anchors actions on the Bitcoin blockchain.did:ion is a very robust, very decentralized platform for anchoring your DIDs. It supports the ability to create, update, recover, and deactivate a DID.DID Documents‚ÄãNow that Alice and Bob have gone through one of the methods and they have their DIDs, they now need a DID document to store those DIDs. Let's learn about DID documents, what they are and what fields we might see in them.What is it?‚ÄãA DID Document is a small json object that has a field for your DID, called id.{  "@context": [    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"  ],  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi"}Every DID can be resolved to a corresponding DID document. A DID resolver is a mechanism that allows you to look up and retrieve the DID document associated with a particular DID.If you type a URL into your browser, it resolves to a web page. Similarly, you can use a service to resolve a DID to a DID document. The document includes fields that help authenticate interactions with the DID.What should be in it?‚ÄãThe only required field is the id field. This value is your DID. You might find many other fields in a DID Document, such as authentication material, encryption key material, and pointers to your DWN. Read more about the fields here.Controller - Subject relationship‚ÄãExample of a Controller Subject relationship diagram, from W3C DID Core SpecOne of the fields you might find in a DID Document is the verificationMethod, which is an array of objects each representing a controlling entity of the DID. The controller field contains controlling entity's DID.{  "@context": [    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"  ],  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",  "verificationMethod": [{    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",    "controller": "did:example:pqrstuvwxyz0987654321",    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"  }]}The easiest way to describe the controller-subject relationship is by coming back to Alice and Bob for an analogy.Alice and Bob (controller group) have a baby. They decide to get their baby a DID. The baby is the subject of the DID, but may not be ready for the responsibility of managing the DID yet. Alice and Bob can use their own DID's verification methods to control their baby's DID on behalf of their baby.DID Key Management‚ÄãYour DIDs are secured with public-private key pairs. You should not let anyone have your private key, because the key material used to secure your DID is how you prove ownership of your DID. You should find a secure way to store your private key, such as through a secured keystore.Alice and Bob have successfully created their DIDs, while learning all about the different methods. They each have their DID documents and are ready to join in on the decentralized fun.

This means you can:Own your data: You decide where to host your node. You control who has access.Back up your data: Host multiple nodes in different places, and keep them all synced effortlessly. If one goes down, you have your backup. Send and receive data: Alice controls her DWN using her DID. Bob controls his DWN with his DID. Alice can send data to Bob just by resolving his DID.Topology of an exchange between Decentralized Web Nodes, duplicated from the DIF Decentralized Web Node SpecAuthorization‚ÄãDWNs have two mechanisms to allow others access to read, write, or delete data on your node.Permissions: Allow someone access to read, write, or delete specific data records on your node.Protocols: Install a protocol that lets you define data types and authorization for a decentralized web app.The easiest way to understand this distinction is to think of permissions as active, explicit, and manual, whereas protocols are passive, syntactic, and contractual.Data Model‚ÄãData types are bound to known schemas, letting applications agree on data models. This opens the door to applications working together in ways that have been much more difficult with traditional development platforms.User-defined schemas are not validated on the payload of the record, as this sort of validation is impossible for encrypted payloads since the DWN doesn't have the private keys to decrypt. It is up the application layer if such validation is to be performed on the data. Messaging‚ÄãAll communication is done through simple JSON objects called messages. Web5 constructs messages and helps you send them to their destination by resolving a recipient's DID and getting the address of their Decentralized Web Node. A message can install protocols, grant permissions, and read, write, update, query, or delete a record. For example, a message writing a record to a DWN may look like the example below.{ // Message  "recordId": "b65b7r8n7bewv5w6eb7r8n7t78yj7hbevsv567n8r77bv65b7e6vwvd67b6",  "descriptor": {    "parentId": CID(PREVIOUS_DESCRIPTOR),    "dataCid": CID(data),    "dateCreated": 123456789,    "published": true,    "encryption": "jwe",    "interface": "Records",    "method": "Write",    "schema": "https://schema.org/SocialMediaPosting",    "commitStrategy": "json-merge",    "dataFormat": "application/json"  }}See the DWN spec for a detailed explanation of each field.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousIdentity (DIDs)NextVerifiable CredentialsPersonal Data StoreAuthorizationData ModelMessaging2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

They are JSON files that serve as a self-contained representation of the DID and provides metadata and cryptographic material associated with the DID. DID Documents describe how to interact with the DID subject and contains information that allows others to verify the authenticity and integrity of the DID's information. The document includes things like the DID subject's public keys, authentication and verification methods, as well as service endpoints, such as DWNs, that reference the locations of the subject‚Äôs data.How to Retrieve a DID Document‚ÄãGiven a person attempts to use their DID within an app to identify themselves, the app would resolve their DID to find their mini-profile (the DID document).To do this in Web5, you'd call the web5.did.resolve() function:const resolution = await web5.did.resolve(userDid);const didDocument = resolution.didDocument;The resolve function will return a DidResolutionResult, which contains the DIDocument object:{  "id":

The structure and contents of a DID Document can vary depending on the specific DID method being used and the requirements of the application or use case.DID Document Management‚ÄãManaging a DID Document is essential to maintain its integrity, relevance, and security. A DID subject can indicate to their authorized user agent (e.g., wallet) a change they'd like to make, and that agent will determine if the DID Document needs to be modified, and if so, will do so on the subject's behalf. Here are a few possible actions:UpdateAs the circumstances of the DID subject change, it's necessary to update the DID Document. For instance, let's say a DID subject has a new DWN and wants to add it to their DID Document as a service endpoint, or perhaps has changed hosting for one of their DWN nodes. This change needs to be reflected in the DID Document.RevokeAt times, it might be essential to revoke certain keys or service endpoints, making them inactive.DeleteAlthough not always advisable due to the immutable nature of some ledgers, a DID Document might sometimes need to be deleted or deactivated.Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousVerifiable CredentialsNextAgentsWhat is a DID DocumentHow to Retrieve a DID DocumentProperties of a DID DocumentDID Document Management2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

In other words, protocols define both the data schema and the data permissions as it relates to a certain application or use case.Protocols are written in a JSON format that is flexible enough to detail what objects are stored as part of the application, as well as who has what permissions on those objects. Although schema and permissions are traditionally decoupled in Web2 development, protocol documents serve as a robust and concise way to define how your application handles data.Protocol Basics‚ÄãEvery protocol document has a few basic keys:types - Defines all the elements used in your protocolstructure - Outlines the relationship and interaction rules between different types$actions - Specifies a set of permissions outlining who is allowed to perform specific actions like reading or writing on a given typeThese terms are combined in a human-readable way to define both the data schema and permissions of your app.To apply these concepts, let's consider if we wanted to build a basic social networking application. In our social network, we want users to be able to add posts and replies, as well as images with captions that can be replied to. This application has a data design of two key objects: posts and images. Images have caption and reply properties, while posts just have a replies property.Now let‚Äôs imagine how we‚Äôd construct the permissions for such an app. We want all users to be able to add images and posts, but we have a few constraints on the other properties:Only the author should be able to add an image captionOnly the recipient(s) or the author of a post should be able to reply to itOnly the recipient(s) of an image should be able to reply to itDefining a Protocol‚ÄãWe know the key words for defining protocols - types, structure, and actions - as well as our data and permissions schemas. So our protocol would look this:const protocolDefinition = {    "protocol": "https://social-media.xyz",    "published": true,    "types": {      "post": {        "schema": "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/postSchema",        "dataFormats": ["text/plain"]      },      "reply": {        "schema": "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/replySchema",        "dataFormats": ["text/plain"]      },      "image": {        "dataFormats": ["image/jpeg"]      },      "caption": {        "schema": "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/captionSchema",        "dataFormats": ["text/plain"]      }    },    "structure": {      "post": {        "$actions": [          {            "who": "anyone",            "can": "read"          },          {            "who": "anyone",            "can": "write"          }        ],        "reply": {          "$actions": [            {              "who": "recipient",              "of": "post",              "can": "write"            },            {              "who": "author",              "of": "post",              "can": "write"            }                      ]        }      },      "image": {        "$actions": [          {            "who": "anyone",            "can": "read"          },          {            "who": "anyone",            "can": "write"          }        ],        "caption": {          "$actions": [            {              "who": "anyone",              "can": "read"            },            {              "who": "author",              "of": "image",              "can": "write"            }          ]        },        "reply": {          "$actions": [            {              "who": "author",              "of": "image",              "can": "read"            },            {              "who": "recipient",              "of": "image",              "can": "write"            }          ]        }      }    }}The value for protocol is a URI that represents the protocol being configured.The published attribute indicates whether the protocol should be public. Published protocols are accessible by anyone who queries for them.{  "protocol": "https://social-media.xyz",  "published": true,}In the types section, we can see how the data schema of each data type is defined. While you‚Äôd ideally use a resolvable schema in this property, that is not a requirement."types": {  "post": {    "schema": "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/postSchema",    "dataFormats": ["text/plain"]  },  "reply": {    "schema": "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/replySchema",    "dataFormats": ["text/plain"]  },  "image": {    "dataFormats": ["image/jpeg"]  },  "caption": {    "schema": "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/captionSchema",    "dataFormats": ["text/plain"]  }},You‚Äôll then notice how each of those types is used in the large structure object, which at a top level houses the post and image data types which are critical to our social network."structure": {  "post": {    "$actions": [      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "read"      },      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "write"      }    ],    "reply": {      "$actions": [        {          "who": "recipient",          "of": "post",          "can": "write"        },        {            "who": "author",            "of": "post",            "can": "write"          }                  ]    }  },  "image": {    "$actions": [      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "read"      },      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "write"      }    ],    "caption": {      "$actions": [        {          "who": "anyone",          "can": "read"        },        {          "who": "author",          "of": "image",          "can": "write"        }      ]    },    "reply": {      "$actions": [        {          "who": "author",          "of": "image",          "can": "read"        },        {          "who": "recipient",          "of": "image",          "can": "write"        }      ]    }  }}Within post, you‚Äôll notice we define actions permissions to let anyone read or write one."post": {    "$actions": [      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "read"      },            {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "write"      }    ],},But then we nest another structure object to hold the child property of reply and define permissions on reply."post": {  "$actions": [      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "read"      },            {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "write"      }  ],  "reply": {    "$actions": [      {        "who": "recipient",        "of": "post",        "can": "write"      },      {        "who": "author",        "of": "post",        "can": "write"      }                ]  }},Additionally, you‚Äôll notice the image object below it also defines actions permissions, along with more child properties and their permissions."image": {  "$actions": [    {      "who": "anyone",      "can": "read"    },    {      "who": "anyone",      "can": "write"    }  ],  "caption": {    "$actions": [      {        "who": "anyone",        "can": "read"      },      {        "who": "author",        "of": "image",        "can": "write"      }    ]  },  "reply": {    "$actions": [      {        "who": "author",        "of": "image",        "can": "read"      },      {        "who": "recipient",        "of": "image",        "can": "write"      }    ]  }}Installing a Protocol‚ÄãTo use a protocol in your app, you‚Äôll need to install that protocol to your DWN. You can do so using the following snippet where protocolDefinition is the messaging protocol object from above:const { protocol, status } = await web5.dwn.protocols.configure({    message: {      definition: protocolDefinition    }});//sends protocol to remote DWNs immediately (vs waiting for sync)await protocol.send(myDid);Once you‚Äôve installed that protocol to your DWN, you‚Äôre ready to communicate using the schema and permissions it defines.Protocols in Practice‚ÄãBuilding on our social media example, let‚Äôs say that you wanted to post a message to your friend Alice. First, ensure that she has also installed the https://social-media.xyz protocol on her DWN. Then, you can write to her DWN via the https://social-media.xyz protocol using:const { record: postRecord, status: createStatus } = await web5.dwn.records.create({  data: 'Hey this is my first post!',  message: {    recipient: aliceDid,    schema: 'https://social-media.xyz/schemas/postSchema',    dataFormat: 'text/plain',    protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,    protocolPath: 'post'  }});Now, let's say Alice wants to reply to the post. Remember, reply is a child of post, therefore this record should reference the post record's id as its parent.const replyResponse = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: "replying to post",    message: {      recipient: senderDid,      protocol: protocolDefinition.protocol,      protocolPath: 'post/reply',      parentId: postRecord.id,      contextId: postRecord.contextId,      schema: "https://social-media.xyz/schemas/replySchema",      dataFormat: 'text/plain',    },})If an app wants to display all of a post's replies, it can obtain the post's record ID and then query for records that have that id as a parentId.const { records: replies } = await web5.dwn.records.query({    message: {        filter: {            parentId: postRecord.id        }    }})And that‚Äôs it! Via the social-media protocol, you‚Äôve now written a message to Alice‚Äôs DWN and she has replied.This protocol enables a basic social network using Web5, which means we‚Äôve created a basic trustless, decentralized social network where your users host all of their own data.Example Protocols‚ÄãHere's a bunch of example protocols for more inspiration!Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousAgentsNextSyncProtocol BasicsDefining a ProtocolInstalling a ProtocolProtocols in PracticeExample Protocols2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

This provides end users with the ability to own their data in resilient and convenient ways. In this guide, we‚Äôll discuss what sync means in the context of DWNs and Web5, how it works, and what it means for you, your apps, and your end users.What is Sync?‚ÄãIn the context of DWNs and Web5, sync is the ability to synchronize all data across a user's multiple DWNs. When an application calls Web5.connect(), by default, a DWN is created that runs in browser memory and is considered a local DWN. In addition, during Web5‚Äôs tech preview period, the SDK automatically defines two additional DWNs that are hosted by TBD and are remotely accessible (e.g., dwn.tbddev.org/dwn0, dwn.tbddev.org/dwn1).When an application takes an action on a user‚Äôs local DWN (i.e., create, update, delete), with sync enabled, that action is automatically replicated to the other DWNs associated with the user‚Äôs DID. To understand the magnitude of this, let‚Äôs consider how we think of sync in our apps today. Dropbox, for example, allows us to synchronize our files across devices, but is dependent on either a web browser or platform-specific app to make that happen. Additionally, end users take a hard dependency on Dropbox to actually maintain the physical infrastructure for storing the data.A service like iCloud may allow for users‚Äô app data to sync across devices, but that functionality is locked to Apple‚Äôs platforms and requires developer input to enable the feature. In Web5.js, the same features that built billion dollar businesses are included, for free, and with even more functionality. Rather than every app being an island that has to figure out how to sync on its own, Web5 abstracts away sync for all of a user‚Äôs apps and data.Agents and Sync‚ÄãSync is orchestrated by an agent, which is responsible for acting on a user‚Äôs behalf to invoke the sync interface between nodes since the nodes themselves don‚Äôt actually implement this interface. In the same way that your browser has a user agent, so does your Web5 environment, which enables its agent to orchestrate privileged activities of user management on your behalf.So why do we have agents to facilitate sync? The primary reason is because Web5 is built from a number of core components and libraries that all need to be knitted together. Libraries for DWN, DID, VC, networking, and more are all required to perform fundamental operations like sync, which is why we delegate that responsibility to an agent rather than asking app developers to perform these tasks. Imagine having to write code to open connections, sign data, and more every time you wanted to send a message to another DWN. Web5 abstracts away this complexity via agents.How Do I Use Sync?‚ÄãThe short answer is: you don‚Äôt have to explicitly think about this. Sync is automatically baked into DWNs created with Web5.js, and will handle syncing a user's local DWN with their remote DWNs. Although support for multiple remote DWNs does work, there are a number of improvements in store for this functionality. For now, you can expect a user who creates multiple DWNs with the same DID to get sync for free between their DWNs. All DWN URIs for a given DID are listed in the associated DID document, so Web5.js knows where to sync a DID subject‚Äôs data to, even if they later add more nodes. We‚Äôve designed sync to be a seamless experience that developers and users alike shouldn't have to think about. Web5 is built to remove the burden of sync development from developers and make data portability and ownership a front-and-center feature.Sync Intervals‚ÄãAlthough sync is designed to be automatic, seamless, and work in the background, it does have a 2 minute trigger interval that may prove too slow for some use cases. For example, in an instant messaging app, syncing your users messages across devices needs to be instantaneous. There could also be scenarios where waiting for sync could lead to race conditions. You can configure sync intervals, or force a sync between a user‚Äôs DWNs by calling record.send().Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousProtocolsNextCreate a DIDWhat is Sync?Agents and SyncHow Do I Use Sync?Sync Intervals2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us

LtdA Verifiable Credential (VC) is a cryptographically-signed statement made by an issuer about a holder (or subject). VCs operate within a three-party model: the Issuer, the Holder (or Subject), and the Verifier.An issuer is the party who is making the claim; while the holder(subject) is the party who the claim is made about. In the example VC where the claim is "Alice has a degree from Decentralized University", Decentralized University would be a credible issuer and Alice would be the subject.The beauty of VCs are that the claims made within them can be verified without needing a middleman. Since VCs are signed by the issuer with some fancy cryptography magic (we'll uncover this magic in a minute), anyone can become a verifier to confirm that the claims are indeed the real-deal. It‚Äôs all about being sure that a claim (like Alice's degree or Bob‚Äôs employment status) isn't just a made up story.Examples of Verifiable Credentials‚ÄãAfter four years of long nights and early mornings, Alice graduates from Decentralized University and is instantly issued a VC from the university proving that she has earned her degree.When Alice begins her job search, she realizes the power of her VC. It acts as a digital diploma. Traditionally, potential employers would hire background check agencies to validate that she graduated‚Äîa process that could drag on for days if not weeks. But with her VC, they can now directly verify her diploma, bypassing traditional drawn-out methods.On a different note, Bob obtains a VC proving that he is an employee of Acme, Inc. When Bob wants to buy a house, he can provide the lender with his employment VC and they can rest assured that he is indeed employed and not a credit risk. Thus, speeding up the approval of his loan.Why are VCs useful?‚ÄãOnline transactions have become a part of our daily lives and with this comes the need to prove things like qualification and authorization. VCs provide a fast, secure approach to this while preserving your privacy. PrivacyVCs are your personal pocket-sized portfolio, where you can share specific details when required. For example, Alice sharing her degree credential, gives potential employers the information she needs, without oversharing Alice's entire academic history (e.g. transcript of every course taken and every grade received) with them. So in this regard, VCs are privacy preserving. Security VCs are cryptographically signed by the issuer. This means that these credentials aren't easy to forge. Think of it as a tamper-proof seal on a medicine bottle, but for your digital identity.SpeedUnlike traditional methods that might involve queues or waiting rooms, VCs allow for quick and instant validation. You don't have to wait for someone on the other end to give you the green light; it's immediate. What makes up a VC?‚ÄãA VC typically contains the following components:Issuer: The entity that creates and signs the VC. This could be a university, government agency, or any other trusted person/organization. In Alice's example, "Decentralized University" serves as the issuer.Subject: The person or entity the VC is about. For instance, in Bob's employment VC, he is the subject. His unique DID ensures that the credential is tied specifically to him. Claim: The specific assertion(s) the issuer is making about the subject. In Alice's degree VC, there could be a claim that states Alice has a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Decentralized Systems.A VC is represented as JSON objects so that they're easy to work with programmatically across various systems. Here's an example VC:{  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",  "type": "VerifiableCredential",  "issuer": "did:example:decuniversity",  "credentialSubject": {    "id": "did:example:alice123",    "name": "Alice",    "degree": "Bachelor‚Äôs in Decentralized Systems",    "completionDate": "2023-08-01"  }  }In this VC, Decentralized University issued a credential verifying that Alice completed a Bachelor's degree in Decentralized Systems on August 1, 2023.How do VCs actually work?‚ÄãRemember the cryptographic brilliance we encountered with DIDs and the pairing of private & public keys? It‚Äôs a critical part of VCs as well.There are different ways to secure VCs, let's look into securing them with JWT. JWT stands for JSON Web Token, a lightweight, URL-safe format that has three distinct components: a header, payload, and signature. Header: Tells you how the JWT was made.Payload: This is the heart of the JWT. It holds all the important details like the issuer, subject, and claim.Signature: This is like the seal on a medicine bottle, ensuring the information in the payload hasn't been touched. Example of an encoded JWT string from Ram PotabattiIn our example, for Alice's potential employer to verify that she did indeed graduate from Decentralized University, Alice would need to give them a Verifiable Presentation that contains her VC's JWT string. The employer(verifier) would then get the university's public key through the Verifiable Data Registry. In order for the university to create that JWT string, they need their pubic-private key pair. The employer would then verify the JWT using the university's public key and the JWT's encoded signature (the characters after the last period in the above string #3).A successful verification tells the employer that the VC is authentic. If this step fails, it's a sign that Alice's VC was forged. After verification, the employer can decode the JWT, as shown on JWT.io to obtain it's payload. The payload contains all the information that is written inside of the VC that Alice has presented to them. The employer can trust that the information contained in the now verified payload was indeed issued by the university.noteTrust is still critical. A VC from ‚ÄúBob‚Äôs Bogus Academy‚Äù might not carry the same credibility as one from a renowned institution. However, since public keys are public, the discovery of them presents a slight risk. How do you know that the public key you were given actually belongs to the issuer, such as Decentralized University? Although the Verifiable Data Registry gives you a way to search for public keys, it still requires a great amount of trust. Always consider the issuer's reputation.Storing and Sharing VCs‚ÄãVCs can be securely stored and managed via identity wallets. When the need arises to share them, it's simply a matter of presenting directly from the wallet, ensuring personal data remains private.Now, with their newfound knowledge of VCs, Alice and Bob are ready to further explore the decentralized web, presenting their credentials with confidence.

You'll learn how to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) data from your users' personal data stores.Let‚Äôs go! üöÄInstallation‚ÄãinfoPrerequisitesNode Package Manager, npm, installed and on your system's $PATH.Node version 18 and above1. Create a directory‚ÄãThis will be the home of your new Web5 app. In your CLI:  mkdir web5-appcd web5-app2. Install Web5‚ÄãUse NPM to initialize a package.json file:npm init -yUse NPM to install Web5:npm install @web5/apiThese steps will create a package.json in the root of your project. Open package.json and add module as a type:{  "dependencies": {    "@web5/api": "0.8.2"  },  "type": "module"}3. Import Web5‚ÄãLet's create an index.js file to write our application:touch index.jsFor Windows using PowerShell:New-Item index.js -ItemType FilenoteAfter npm resolves the dependency, you may see a few warnings. You can ignore these for now.Open index.js in your editor and add this line at the top of the file to import Web5:import { Web5 } from '@web5/api';Additional import for Node 18/*Needs globalThis.crypto polyfill.

Instantiate Web5 and Create DID‚ÄãIn Web5 apps, a user‚Äôs unique identifier - like an email address - is called a Decentralized Identifier (DID).
We are building a decentralized app, so your users are using identifiers that aren't tied to a centralized authority.The Web5 class is an isolated API object for doing all things Web5. The connect() function creates an instance of Web5 and also creates a decentralized identifier or obtains connection to an existing one.In index.js below the import statement, create a new instance of Web5:const { web5, did: aliceDid } = await Web5.connect();This Web5 instance is what you'll use to access the other objects of Web5 such as did and dwn. Within the connect function we‚Äôre using ion as the DID method. Learn more about ION and other DID methods.infoWeb5 is split into three main top-level objects:web5.didweb5.dwnweb5.vcTest your code  Wanna see the DID you just created?   In index.js, add the following line and save your file:console.log(aliceDid);  Then from the terminal, run:node index.js  You'll see the newly created DID.Try it!‚ÄãRun ‚Ä∫DID Creation ProgressYour DID will appear here2. Write DWN Records‚ÄãNow you‚Äôre able to write records in the user's Decentralized Web Node(DWN).A DWN is a personal data store - a platform for messages, pictures, videos, medical records, and just about any content a user may want to store.Read more about DWNYour app should not store users' data in your centralized database. Instead, their data should be stored in their DWN. This is how the user retains ownership over their content. Through permissions, users can decide which apps can read, write, and delete content from their DWN.The DWN exists in local storage under the name dwn-info. The DWN persists across browser sessions and can be synched across a user's devices.A user can host their DWN in mulitple locations. The Web5 SDK is both browser and Node.js compliant, meaning you can use the same APIs on both client side and serverside.Add the following to index.js:const { record } = await web5.dwn.records.create({    data: 'Hello, Web5!',    message: {      dataFormat: 'text/plain',    },  });Test your codeLet's see what was just written to the DWN.  In index.js, add the following line and save your file:console.log('writeResult', record);  Then from the terminal, run:node index.js  You'll see the record that was written to the user's DWN. It will resemble:  writeResult _Record {}Enter "Hello Web5" in the input field and click "Run" to write a record to the sandbox DWN.Try it!‚ÄãYour messageRun ‚Ä∫Write progressYour message will appear here3. Read DWN Records‚ÄãIf the user has given your app read permissions to their DWN, you can read their data by accessing it through the record property. If you don't already have access to the record, you can query to obtain it.To return the text data stored in the record, add the following to index.js:const readResult = await record.data.text();Test your codeTo see the record that was read from the DWN, add the following to index.js:console.log('readResult', readResult)Then from the terminal, run:node index.jsThe output will resemble:Hello Web5Try it!‚ÄãRun ‚Ä∫Read progressYour read result will appear here4. Update DWN Records‚ÄãTo update the record, call update on the record object itself.Add the following to index.js:const updateResult = await record.update({    data: 'Hello, Web5! I am updated.',  });Test your codeTo see the record that was updated in the DWN, add the following to index.js:console.log('updateResult', await record.data.text())Then from the terminal, run:node index.jsThe output will resemble:updateResult Hello, I'm updated!Enter "Hello, I'm updated" in the input field and click "Run!" to update the record in the sandbox DWN:Try it!‚ÄãYour updated messageRun ‚Ä∫Update progressYour updated message will appear here5. Delete DWN Records‚ÄãGiven permission from the user, your app can delete records from their DWN. Similar to reading, we‚Äôll use the record object to remove the record.Add the following to index.js:const deleteResult = await record.delete();Test your codeTo see the status of the delete transaction, add the following to index.js:console.log('deleteResult', deleteResult)Then from the terminal, run:node index.jsThe output will resemble:{ status: { code: 202, detail: 'Accepted' } }Try it!‚ÄãRun ‚Ä∫Delete progressThe result of your delete operation will appear hereSummary‚ÄãCongrats! You've just created a local DWN to serve as your user's
personal data store. Given a user's DID and appropriate permissions, your app can read, write, or delete data from the user's DWN, while
leaving them in full control of their content.infoDownload the completed index.js fileView source code for the interactive sandbox of this QuickstartRun interactive sandbox directly in your browserNext Steps‚ÄãLearn more about DIDsLearn more about DWNsBuild a decentralized ToDo app Was this page helpful?Connect with us on DiscordSubmit feedback: Open a GitHub issueEdit this page: GitHub RepoContribute: Contributing GuidePreviousAPI ReferenceNextIdentity (DIDs)2023LegalCode of ConductTBD HomeConnect with us
